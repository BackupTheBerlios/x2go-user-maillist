</I>&gt;<i> Hello to everybody,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is our first post on x2go. Sorry if the question seems stupid or if we are not at the right place.
</I>&gt;<i> We googled during days without finding a precise answer...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have to use thin clients to connect to x2go-servers.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, we looked the &quot;Installation of the X2Go TCE based on Debian&quot; (<A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:tce">http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:tce</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> That looks not bad&#160;&#160; :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But we cannot use a PXE server.
</I>&gt;<i> So, we need the &quot;same&quot; thing, but on a CD, or better, on an USB key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We saw on archived posts (for example: <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/x2go-dev@lists.berlios.de/msg02233.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/x2go-dev@lists.berlios.de/msg02233.html</A>) that this question was discussed, but not considered &quot;making sense&quot;.
</I>
Well, that's not what was said. Mike pointed out that maintaining both
does not make sense. The thing is, I'm quite sold on using the
live-build infrastructure to create live images over the X2go TCE
scripts, so I've hacked something together for our department's x2go
environment.

&gt;<i> The links which are given there (for example for &quot;apt-get install x2go-rootfs&quot;) do not seem any more up to date...
</I>&gt;<i> And the wiki &quot;X2Go Live&quot; (<A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:x2golive">http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:x2golive</A>) seems... empty.
</I>
The branch can be found here:
<A HREF="https://code.launchpad.net/~siretart/x2go/x2go-live.oneiric">https://code.launchpad.net/~siretart/x2go/x2go-live.oneiric</A>

Note that this works for oneiric with the live-build packages that I
have backported and put in my PPA.

I did not port this yet to precise, but I will eventually get to that.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For other reasons, we use a little &quot;live-build&quot; (<A HREF="http://live.debian.net/">http://live.debian.net/</A>) but we are not experts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our first question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After runnig &quot;x2gothinclient_update&quot; we have a &quot;X2go TCE chroot&quot; (under /opt/x2gothinclient/chroot/).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a simple way to use this directory with live-build to build a binary image?
</I>&gt;<i> That is, avoiding the &quot;bootstrap&quot; stage and the &quot;chroot&quot; stage, but starting directly with the &quot;binary&quot; stage?
</I>
I didn't see much point in doing that. The x2goclient, etc. packages
are available form PPAs and installing .deb package with the
live-build infrastructure are a much more straight-forward solution
IMO.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our second (more global) question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like the &quot;X2go TCE chroot&quot; (under /opt/x2gothinclient/chroot/) obtained with &quot;x2gothinclient_create&quot; is built in a similar way what live-build could do (are we wrong?).
</I>
AFAIUI, they have roughly the same goal, albeit live-build is much
more generic and customizable.

&gt;<i> As said previously (in the archive posts), it seems that the project x2go decided not to maintain both solutions: TCE and live-build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, *maybe* would-it be possible to maintain both results for a single effort?
</I>&gt;<i> live-build can build different kinds of images (lb_config -b|--binary-images iso|iso-hybrid|net|tar|hdd) of which &quot;net&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of maintaining the &quot;x2gothinclient_create&quot; package, would it not be possible to just maintain the accurate options to be entered to &quot;lb config&quot;, &quot;lb build&quot;, etc... and the additional &quot;includes&quot; or &quot;modified packages&quot; or &quot;hooks&quot; and to let the user choose between the options &quot;--binary-images&quot; (&quot;hdd&quot; or &quot;net&quot;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus both needs could be satisfied just with a single effort&#160; ;-)
</I>
If oneiric is OK for you, you can have a look at my oneiric branch. If
you need precise, you can either forward-port it yourself (it will
probably require some change due to a newer live-build version) or
wait until I eventually find some spare time to do it.

Cheers,
Reinhard.
