<PRE>Mike

I've had private msgs from several folks about this edit of fixing this
same problem for them also and I think all of them were 64bit linux.
Below is yesterday's post to the x2go-user alias by another person.

I've not had time yet to try a combo of 32 bit client &amp; server to see if
x2go &amp; ssh are different with this setting than 64bit but will try to do so
this weekend if possible.    If there is a difference then its either the
ssh libraries/implementation or its an x2go s/w difference in how the x64
and x32 are working.

FYI, per your request I had already deleted the wiki entry for this last
week.

Brian

the regular x2go client but I will check if there is a difference between
the two.   But I do know that changing that sshd_config entry back to no
causes x2go session to fail and changing it to yes .. works.I'll try pyhoca
first before deleting the wiki entry.---------- Forwarded message ----------

x2goclient and pyhoca-gui without the above change being applied.   Please
check your setup again and remove the part in the wiki that suggests the
above named change. Or explain in more detail why you think this is
necessary. Let's track this down fully, so we get a clearer sight on what
is happening here.  On the server you now also must install
x2goserver-xsession
&gt;<i> *sudo apt-get install x2goserver-xsession*

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reporting this. This indeed may have been a bug in
</I>x2goruncommand.  My patch is currently being discussed on the x2go-dev
ML:
<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commitdiff;h=c13ffe1cb2c39edfacab52bc62e278469da19c9e">http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commitdiff;h=c13ffe1cb2c39edfacab52bc62e278469da19c9e</A>
&gt;<i> With the given patch applied, the x2goserver-xsession package becomes
</I>optional again. Packages for testing will be available in the
nightly-builds soon.
&gt;<i> So basically, I think, we should remove this part from the wiki again, as
</I>well. But before doing that, we have to wait for acceptance of my patch by
the other developers.
&gt;<i> Greets,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>*
I was having the same problem as you on Lubuntu 12.04 (which uses LXDE) and
I can confirm that your sshd_config change fixed it for me. Of note, Top
shows 3 zombie processes as soon as x2goserver is installed and running.
Still shows it,
but at least now it is working.

Also 64-bit (running in Hyper-V). *
