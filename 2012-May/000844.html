<PRE>I need assistance getting X2Go working. I have Ubuntu 12.04 running x2go
server and OSX as the x2go client. I can ssh into ubuntu from mac. I cannot
get x2go working - no matter what. The errors messages are non-descript and
neither google or the documentation has been any help.

I get - (1) The server is unknown. Do you trust the host key? Public key
has ....  in spite of having the public key in authorized_keys and the
server in known_hosts.

After responding Yes to the prompt above I get - No public key matchesd
Access Denied. Authentication that can continue: publickey,
keyboard-interactive.

Pressing OK then follows with the username/password prompt. I put in the
correct username and password.

The system repeats again the same 'The server is unknown message from  (1)
above.

It does not matter whether I allow sshd to use clear passwords or not.

I kindly ask for your assistance.


That request said, let me say this: I think this project is fantastic and
has a lot of promise. However, as long as connectivity between server and
client remains more difficult than what it should, and remains badly
documented, then the entire project effort is meaningless. The entire
project is therefore less than useless.

I have some 20 years systems engineering/software development experience
and am generally the most technical person in most companies that I work
at, which is saying something when there are about 500 technical resources
at any point in time.

If I get frustrated with setting up simple connectivity then clearly it is
beyond the average user - who by the way is your target audience.

Again, please help me connect and understand how and why it fails to
connect/authenticate.

Sincerely,
