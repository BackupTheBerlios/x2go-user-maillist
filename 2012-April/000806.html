<PRE>In the past I and others have had no problem with x2go client logins to
Ubuntu/Debian x2goservers.

However, sometime n the past year or two of Ubuntu &amp; Debian OS updates
something changed which caused the normal x2goclient session profile that
requires the UserID -and- Password to be entered would fail giving an error
message on the client that says:

*Access denied. Authentication that can continue:
publickey,keyboard-interactive*

I finally found out the reason for this change in behavior and here's how
to fix it.

Get a terminal session with your x2goserver and edit */etc/ssh/sshd_config*

*sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config*

in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (example was copied from Ubuntu 12.04) you will see
the following entries:

*# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords (beware issues with
# some PAM modules and threads)
ChallengeResponseAuthenticatio**n yes

# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
PasswordAuthentication no*

To fix this CHANGE   *PasswordAuthentication* to &quot;*yes*&quot; and save the file
and restart ssh

*sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart*

*REASON for the failure &amp; change of behavior from previous/older versions
of Ubuntu.*
I installed several older versions of Ubuntu going back to Ubuntu 9.10 and
found that the installations of the Ubuntu Server changed the content of
the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file!

In older systems the entry for PasswordAuthentication either said:

*# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
# PasswordAuthentication no*

where the PasswordAuthentication line *was commented out* ... which then
defaulted it to &quot;YES&quot;
*-or-*
the Password Authentication line was actually uncommented BUT set to &quot;YES&quot;

*# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
PasswordAuthentication yes*

So those older OS versions and x2go *would work* using login ID's and
Passwords.

Sometime during one of the Ubuntu 11.x releases the PasswordAuthentication
entry was actually changed to &quot;no&quot; as is the case in Ubuntu 12.04 servers
and the line was left not commented out so it was active...

*# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
PasswordAuthentication no
*

That is what caused the failure of x2go logins using passwords and would
present the user with that error message:

*Access denied. Authentication that can continue:
publickey,keyboard-interactive*

I've made this change now and no longer see the problem on my servers so I
wanted to share this info.
