<PRE>I recently had reported installing x2goserver on a totally new server
machine and the x2goclient on a totally new client machine both running
Ubuntu 12.04 beta 2 and the fact that when trying to start an x2go session
it would always indicate &quot;running&quot; then immediately fail/terminate.

I've found out the following.

After adding the x2go PPA for debian/ubuntu

*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable
sudo apt-get update*

In the past all I've had to do on the server was install x2goserver

*sudo apt-get install x2goserver*

then edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and enable ChallengeResponseAuthentication
to YES

*ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes*

However, with the new x2go versions apparently that is NOT they only module
that needs to be installed.

On the server you now also must install x2goserver-xsession
*
sudo apt-get install x2goserver-xsession*

My best guess is that this was introduced when the new x2go versions
implemented the ability to *published apps* on the x2go server without
having to install any sort of desktop environment on the remote &quot;server&quot;
machine.

After installing the x2goserver-xsession the x2goclient now successfully
creates a remote desktop session with one caveate... I've had to setup the
remote server for ssh automatic login

If using Ubuntu refer to:
<A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys</A>

If I do not do this then the login to the remote server will always fail
due to some ssh failure but I am not sure if its the client or server side
that fails but that is another problem to figure out later.   At least I
can get a remote desktop now.

I'm not sure if the above change was documented anywhere on the x2go wiki
but I will check and add it if it doesn't exist yet.
