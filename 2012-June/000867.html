<PRE>Dear all,

The X2Go Project is proud to announce a couple of new X2Go component releases:

   - x2goclient (3.99.2.1)
   - pyhoca-gui (0.2.0.0)
   - pyhoca-cli (0.2.0.1)
   - python-x2go (0.2.0.3)

All new packages will be available in our stable repositories (Debian,  
   Ubuntu) within the next 24h.

The Mac OS version of x2goclient will be available within the next  
couple of days, the Windows client takes a little more time due to  
heavy workload on the developers' side.

Sources and binary releases will be downloadable under this URL as   
soon as they are provided by the packagers.
<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/releases/">http://code.x2go.org/releases/</A>

I personally am very proud to be able to present a long-waited-for  
major release of Python X2Go and PyHoca-GUI. Thanks to Dick Kniep  
(<A HREF="http://www.lindix.nl">http://www.lindix.nl</A>) for sponsoring this piece of software.

The latest API documentation of Python X2Go can be read here:

Note: for Python X2Go, PyHoca-GUI and PyHoca-CLI, there has been a  
license change with this release. The three projects since 0.2.0.0 are  
versioned under the GNU Affero General Public License 3 (or higher) /  
AGPL-3+.

     - Be more tolerant against suspension failures while taking over  
a session.

     - Prohibit simultaneous calls to terminal_session.share_local_folders().
     - Cache SSH transport's getpeername() and get_username().

     - Add new session profile parameter: ,,variant''. Add support to set the
       keyboard layout _and_ the keyboard variant from the client-side.
     - Give functionality to the ,,setdpi'' and the ,,dpi'' session profile

Dear all,

The X2Go Project is proud to announce a couple of new X2Go component releases:

   - x2goserver (3.1.0.1)
   - nx-libs incl. x2goagent (3.5.0.12)
   - x2goclient (3.99.1.1)
   - x2gothinclient (1.0.1.6)

All new packages will be available in our stable repositories (Debian,  
  Ubuntu) within the next 24h.

The windows and Mac OS versions of x2goclient will probably be  
available tomorrow, as well. (PING: @Mihai, @Oleksandr).

Sources and binary releases will be downloadable under this URL as  
soon as they are provided by the packagers.
<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/releases/">http://code.x2go.org/releases/</A>

The new X2Go Server version adds ~/.x2go_logout script support to the  
server-side of X2Go and fixes the x2goserver-fmbindings Makefile.

The NX (redistributed) code tree has received a fix for the main  
Makefile. Also a patch for building on Mac OS X 10.5 has been  
included, plus an X2Go related patch by Oleksandr. On top of that, we  
have fixed installation of libnx-x11 (Debian package) on 64-bit  
systems with multi-arch support (i.e. Debian wheezy+sid).

X2GoClient and X2Go TCE have received some improvements, too. The  
shutdown button is now fully implemented witin X2GoClient, the  
x2gothinshutdown package has been dropped. The TCE also received a new  
and more colourful boot splash.

At this point I would like to explicitly thank Mihai Moldovan for  
investing his time into X2Go Client development on Mac OS X. Mihai has  
contributed some great patches to the X2Go Client code and has also  
taken over the building of the Mac OS X binary of X2Go Client  
(including nx-libs-lite i.e. nxproxy+libxcomp3). The X2Go  
project--with Mihai on board--is now able to offer the X2Go Client for  
current Mac OS X versions again. Thanks for that, Mihai!!!

light+love,
Mike



x2goserver (3.1.0.1-0~x2go1) RELEASE; urgency=low

   * New upstream version (3.1.0.1):
     - Provide infrastructure for on-logout script calls.
     - Do only run session cleanup scripts from within
       x2goruncommand. Dropping them from x2goterminate-session.
     - Be tolerant against x2go_logout script failures.
     - Fix Makefile of x2goserver-fmbindings (thanks to Oliver Burger),
       improve uninstall code in Makefiles.

nx-libs (2:3.5.0.12-0) RELEASE; urgency=low

   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * Update patch: 001_add-main-makefile.full+lite.patch, adapt patch from
     packaging. Test for Makefiles in subfolders before calling them.
     Fixes build failure during ,,make distclean'' calls.
   * Provide temporary workaround for installation on Debian 64bit with
     multiarch support (via libnx-x11.postinst and .prerm).
   * Re-introduce proper Xinerama support on non-multiarch systems.

   [ Mihai Moldovan ]
   * Add patch: 051_nxcomp_macos105-fdisset.full+lite.patch, work around
     issue in Mac OS X 10.5 SDK. Pass address of fd_set structs on the stack
     to the FD_ISSET macro/function, instead of the struct itself.
   * Update patch: 005_nxcomp_gcc43.full+lite.patch, fix faulty path to
     nxcomp/Split.cpp.

   [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
   * Add patch: 203_nxagent_disable-rootless-exit.full.patch, add command line
     argument &quot;-norootlessexit&quot;. Usually, nxagent exits after 30 seconds if
     running in rootless mode and no X-Clients are present. Starting nxagent
     with option &quot;-norootlessexit&quot; will change this behaviour.
