<PRE>Hi John,

Well it seems to be a problem with the client installation. On my client (WinXP SP3) the balance for &quot;wav&quot; was set to 100% left. I just did an installation (x2goclient-3.99.0.5-setup.exe) on a second client&#160; (also WinXP SP3) with the same result. Before installation all levers were in the middle position. After installing the client software the lever for wav (only this one) was set to left. If you move the lever back to the middle everything works in stereo so far but this seems to be a caveat. There is still no sound during login but I can live with that.

Now I have the next problem. I tested with watching videos on youtube. At first everything works fine but after approx. five minutes sound stops working. If you select another video flash seems to wait for something. If you try to exit/close firefox you have to wait some seconds. Do you have any suggestions what may cause this? With a local login everything works for at last ten minutes so I&#160; assume it is no problem with the server.

Regards
Frank

The stereo issues is strange and I can't imagine how that is X2Go
related.&#160; Do you have the same &quot;mono&quot; problem with other applications,
e.g., playing the same video in VLC or mplayer? If so, it may be a
pulseaudio configuration issue.&#160; If not, it may be a flash/browser
configuration issue - John
