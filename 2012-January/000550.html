<PRE>What version of Windows client are you using?

 

[Michael] :  version 3.99.0.4

 

What is KFCE? If you selected &quot;GNOME&quot; in the client, how can it know to
start KFCE?

 

[Michael] I hadn't thought about that. I thought it knew from your login
profile which DE you used.

 

Did you mean XFCE?

 

[Michael] Sorry, XFCE yes

 

I still use the 3.01-13 client, since all the newer ones have various
problems. But even with those problems, I can still connect with the newer
versions. I just tested 3.99.0.4, and I could connect (but it still have
problems, most notably it freezes when trying to play most youtube videos).

 

Anyway, I use XFCE, and I choose &quot;Custom&quot; in the client, and give it the
command &quot;/usr/bin/startxfce4&quot; and it gives me almost the same startup
messages as you posted, but it does connect and allow me to use the desktop
normally (except all the clients have a bug where it sets the Windows window
size too small when you choose a custom resolution, say 800x600, the windows
client sets the outer dimensions of the window to 800x600 but of course the
windows title bar takes up 25-30 pixels, so the window ends up being too
small to display an 800x600 desktop).

 

[Michael] Tried that, no change

 

I wonder why the client does not have XFCE as an option.

[Michael] That would be nice
