<PRE>Hi to Everyone

Have an issue with x2go that is probably a very simple issues but its 
doing my head in.

I have a Ubuntu server with x2go installed as the preferred method of 
linking up with the desktop ( from OVH).

I installed the windows front end of x2go on to both my win 7 pro desk 
top and work's laptop using default settings.

I then started a new session entering all my detail of the server in the 
appropriate slots and connected to the server no issue first time.

Then whilst configuring my server i messed a couple of things up and 
decided to reinstall the OS , no issue on that front .

But this is where the issue lies  every time i try to connect to the 
server now using x2go it says

&quot;Authentication Failed:  Host key for server has changed , Its is now ( 
and then gives the key code) for security reasons connection will be 
stopped&quot;

  and then the whole x2go program crashes, I have deleted the session 
and started a new one but same issue.

I have even tried to uninstall x2go , then reinstalling but when i do 
this i always have a session with my ip from the server already in the 
program ( as if it is leaving a cach somewhere of old sessions) i have 
been to documents and settings and deleted all hidden .pub files and 
x2go folders that are left after uninstall.


Any body shed any light on this very simple but annoying issue


I can connect to the server via putty and NXmachine no issue but x2go is 
been a little stubborn

Regards


Mike
