Hi, Frank.  Interesting about the leftist tendencies of X2Go (not that I
can speak for the political affiliations of the developers but I just
couldn't resist given the current political climate in the US :) ).

Our environment is entirely WAN based so we openly state that video is
not supported; that's why we are so interested in SPICE as it matures
and in Mike Gabriel's mediabox (if I remembered the name correctly).
Thus, I can't be of much help on the YouTube issue other than to say
that Flash and Linux seem like a match made in Hell - at least on 64
bit.  Do you have the same problem if you use a 32 bit X2Go Server? I
don't know if that is practical for you.

That and 64 bit issues with Firefox Prism which is used in the Zimbra
Desktop Client are making us consider transitioning from 64 bit X2Go
Servers to running 32 bit X2GoServers as guests (one per user) on a 64
bit VServer host.  Good luck - John
