<PRE>Dear all,

This message concerns a longtanding bug bothering KDE users.  Most likely 
the bug is with KDE and not NX, but perhaps someone here can help us find 
out exactly what's causing the problem.

First, a description of how things normally work with KDE's e-mail client, 
KMail:  If one invokes the &quot;New Message&quot;, &quot;Forward&quot;, or &quot;Reply&quot; command on 
a message, a composer window opens.  You can then type your message and 
send it, at which point the composer window closes.  If you close KMail 
while one or more composer windows are still open, then the next time you 
launch KMail, those composer windows are restored so you can resume writing 
the messages where you left off.

The problem is that if you launch KMail from an NX session, the composer 
window usually doesn't appear when you invoke the &quot;Forward&quot; or &quot;Reply&quot; 
commands.  I think the composer windows must be created, but for some 
reason they are not immediately visible, because if you quit and relaunch 
KMail (still over NX), the composer windows you created last time suddenly 
appear.

The problem happens usually but not always.  (That is, sometimes when you 
launch KMail, the Forward and Reply commands will work for a time, but then 
they'll stop working, and will never work again for that session.)  The 
problem also never happens with the &quot;New message&quot; command, even though to 
all outward appearances the same sort of composer window is being launched.

So far I've reproduced the problem with both NoMachine NX and x2go.

Anyone have any idea where the problem might lie?  Is there some sort of 
fine-grained debug logging I can enable in x2go which prints a message 
every time it tries to display a new window?

Regards,
Tristan
