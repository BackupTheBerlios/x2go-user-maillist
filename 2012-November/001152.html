<PRE>Hi list,

I was in contact with Mike Gabriel and he suggested, that I post some 
issues to the list, so here I am ...

We are going to migrate our Terminalserver-farm from freeNX to x2go and 
are heaviliy testing the new infrastructure. First I have to say, that 
x2go is running very good 'out of the box'.

Our Test-Setup is as follows:

2 debian wheezy amd64 server (1 AMD Opteron 6128 6-core and 1 Core2 Quad 
Q6600 with 8Gb RAM each) connected through 1Gb Ethernet running 
x2goserver 3.1.1.4 (I know, 3.1.1.9 is the actual Version ...) and KDE 4.8.4

Both x2goserver are configured with Postgres Backend and we have an 
Loadbalancer with IPVS in front of them.

x2goclient version is 3.99.3.0 and 3.99.2.1

In our productive environment we will have round about 700 users 
connected running an KDE4 DE in Kiosk mode using own coded Software 
(mostly Gambas2 &amp; 3 and Python programs), libreoffice, okular and 
iceweasel/firefox.

We experienced browser freezes with iceweasel 10.0.10 and firefox 13.0.1 
after some time of browser-inactivity (&gt;= 15 min). I didn't found any 
logentries (neither syslog or .xsession-x2go-erros on server nor on 
client) and the system load is normal ...

The client, from which these freezes are observed is a Dualhead PC with 
nvidia graphic card running the x2go-session in fullscreen mode with 
xinerama extension and it seems, that the freezes do not occur on 
clients with only one Display attached.

We have flashplugin-nonfree installed, no browser addons, but those 
freezes are not limited to any flashsites. They occur on several 
websites including 'normal' howto sites (eg. gambas helpsite) and 
phpmyadmin.

The next thing I want to point out is up to sound (pulseaudio) and 
suspended sessions. If sound is activated an a user suspends his 
session, there is strange pulseaudio related logfileflooding. Every 
second I get:

[pulseaudio] main.c: User-configured server at localhost:30014, refusing 
to start/autospawn.

After saying that, I have to admit, that suspend is something we don't 
want in our setup. I linked x2gosuspend-session to x2goterminate-session 
to always terminate the session even if the client gives suspend as 
signal (thanks to Mike for the hint).

I think thats it for now :)

So long,

Tim Kruse
