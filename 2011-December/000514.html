<PRE>Hello,

I have been using freenx for a few years, and have been looking for
something better since freenx is no longer maintained and sound support is
shaky. I was very glad to find the x2go project, specially since it works
exactly like I imagine with diskless thin clients (I have to use USB sticks
to boot my current clients for freenx).

Anyway, after being somewhat confused by the outdated info and repositories
listed on x2go.org, I found the wiki and was able to install x2goserver
(onto Ubuntu  ) and configure a PXE thin client environment. To my
surprise, the thin clients booted on the first attempt and x2goclient came
up, which was very unexpected!

Now I have the following problem:
- I can login without problem from a windows x2goclient onto my ubuntu
x2goserver
- however any attempt to login from the pxe booted thin clients fails.

The client displays (after starting nxproxy 3.5)
Connecting to remote host 'localhost:33001'
And then
Connection timeout aborting

On the server I find these logs:

/usr/bin/x2goagent: line 1: -e: command not found

NXAGENT - Version 3.4.0

Copyright (C) 2001, 2007 NoMachine.
See <A HREF="http://www.nomachine.com/">http://www.nomachine.com/</A> for more information.

Info: Agent running with pid '24505'.
Session: Starting session at 'Fri Dec 16 22:11:43 2011'.
Info: Proxy running in server mode with pid '24505'.
Info: Waiting for connection from 'localhost' on port '30001'.
Info: Aborting the procedure due to signal '1'.
Error: Aborting session with 'X2goagent: Unable to open display
'nx/nx,options=/home/jean/.x2go/C-jean-50-1324102301_stDGNOME_dp24/options:50''.
Session: Aborting session at 'Fri Dec 16 22:12:15 2011'.
Session: Session aborted at 'Fri Dec 16 22:12:15 2011'.

I understand that there is some kind of callback procedure whereby the
client connects to the server, and then the server connects back to the
client, and this seems to be failing. I do not know how else to proceed.

In addition to version 3.99.0.2 of x2goclient and x2goplugin (which was the
one installed by default in the chroot environment), I also tried version
3.99.0.3 from the unstable repository, and an older 3.01-21, all with no
luck.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Jean
