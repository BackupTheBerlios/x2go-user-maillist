<PRE>No I must say, it's unstable under linux too, not only win7.
 My server side is with automatic updates switched on and I see multiple
times in week a notifications about that. Sometimes it will suggest me to
reboot my computer to update but I will not do it before weekend -
somewhere in the saturday evening but not at every week.
 My linux client side is with automatic updates turned off and I will
update it manually at friday afternoon (if I remember to do it and if I
have a time to do it) before turning off for the weekend.
 So it is very hard to tell which updates and at which side was a cause of
the problems. Windows client is updated very rarely. But somewhere at last
two weeks I started to see problems connecting to suspended x2go sessions.
After then I updated also windows client but no better
stability.
 If I connect from linux client it will disconnect me after I try to
connect to my suspended session (for a moment I can see my desktop and
sometimes I can click something and run a command or two). Every time I
see my suspended session (with ID number) so I will assume my login was
correct. After few retries (number of times differ from day to day) I will
get a connection and it is stable until evening then I disconnect it
before going home.
 At home I will connect from windows client and also there is login
correct because I see my suspended session with ID number (sometimes it is
not 50 but over that but this is a same until I must make a new session).
If I try to resume this session I will sometimes see my desktop for a few
seconds (and sometimes I can click and run a command or two) but it will
disconnect me again saying something about my incorrect credentials. After
few retries I will get my session and this is stable until i disconnect it
later. PyHoca-GUI is more stable and with this I can reconnect better. I
have'nt used windows x2go-client for a last week or two anymore.
But there are also cases there after a few unsuccessfull reconnections
PyHoca-GUI will not show my suspended session anymore and I must start a
new one. And there is a new session at the server - the old one is gone
with all related programs closed.
