<PRE>Hi,

First off, thank you, so very much, to the x2go team. I support ~100 
Gnome (soon to be MATE) desktop users in 4 offices in 3 States using 
FreeNX, and will be migrating to x2go over the next few weeks as we move 
to our new Debian 7.2 x2go server. I couldn't continue to do it without you!

I'm quite impressed with the multimedia capabilities out of the box. 
Over the WANs, I can comfortably watch YouTube videos. The video is 
choppy, but serviceable. And the sound is flawless. Unfortunately, 
watching the same quality videos in, say, VLC, results in unusably 
stuttery sound. And even desktop sounds are choppy. The default alert 
&quot;choing&quot; plays the first few tenth of a second or so, pauses briefly, 
and then finishes. I assume Pulse Audio is just streaming the sound 
uncompressed. Is there any way to improve that situation? Any sort of 
compression (even ssh -C) might be an improvement. Or perhaps there's 
something that can be done with the buffering?

I have managers in remote offices who would have need light usage of 
multimedia, for viewing multimedia resum&#233;s, etc.

-Steve Bergman

P.S. I enjoyed watching Mike Gabriel's talk from Debconf 13 on youtube, 
yesterday. I watched the whole thing a couple of times... over x2go from 
our new server, across town. :-)
