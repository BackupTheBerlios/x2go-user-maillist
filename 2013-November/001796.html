<PRE> &gt; I am using X2Go Client and we are facing Latency issues when 
developers use it from different country and they use graphics 
functionalities.
---

I'm new to x2go, but have a good bit of experience administering FreeNX 
for business desktops served over WANs. In Session Preferences -&gt; 
Connection, experiment with the slider settings. In particular, MODEM, 
ISDN, and ADSL. I find that ADSL works best over my 3 - 10 mbit/s WANs. 
But if yours are slower, MODEM or ISDN might work better. On a fast WAN, 
MODEM and ISDN make the updates clunkier by limiting the update rate, 
and possibly other things. It's hard to predict all interactions. But 
you might even try 'WAN' for a relatively high bandwidth, high latency 
connection. The higher slider levels are good for latency. But note that 
'LAN' provides no compression at all. It's likely to perform quite badly.

Also, on that same page, you can reduce the image quality, which 
defaults to 9 (highest quality) but supports a range from 0 to 9. I'm 
not familiar enough with the &quot;Method&quot; options to make a recommendation. 
I suspect the default is probably pretty good.

To give you an idea what you should be able to expect, NX technology 
over a 3mbit full duplex link with a ~150 - 200ms latency between sites 
provides very usable business desktops (Mail, browsing, Libreoffice) for 
my ~100 desktop users. About 50 of those are over the WAN, and the rest 
are on the local LAN. I know of nothing that even remotely compares to 
FreeNX/x2go for performance over a WAN.

Please experiment and report back. I'm interested in your results. And 
please tell us more about your problematic workload. The ping times to 
the clients, the nominal bandwidth, etc.

-Steve
