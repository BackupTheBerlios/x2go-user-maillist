<PRE>Thanks Steve.

I have tried VNCs before and I found X2Go better than any other. I tried to
throttle using Charles with specifying 300-400 ms latency but from my
location, it always shows the same result (70ms ping time).

I am going to try some other tool to check this issue. It is possible to
change few settings in java application like heap memory etc.
