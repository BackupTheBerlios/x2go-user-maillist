<PRE>Hi Brian,

Den 19. feb. 2012 17:17, skrev brian mullan:
&gt;<i> I wanted to make a suggestion to the x2go Community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone knows how fast and how much x2go has been changing in regards 
</I>&gt;<i> to features, capabilities, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like most projects Documentation is hard to keep up with but to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> growing the x2go Community as fast in the future as it has in the past 
</I>&gt;<i> year or so I'd like to suggest the date for a week of focused x2go 
</I>&gt;<i> Wiki updating/cleanup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For success - it would take the commitment of both the x2go Community 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; the Core-Devs and some planning.    By that I mean try to come up 
</I>&gt;<i> with ways to impact the core-dev team the least but maximize their 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of x2go config, install, operation &amp; troubleshooting so the 
</I>&gt;<i> Community people can do the actual editing of the Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * identify &amp; input any missing information
</I>&gt;<i>   * all the FIX ME place-holders should be addressed
</I>&gt;<i>   * incorrect or out of date information should be updated or removed
</I>&gt;<i>   * add any new information that just hasn't found time to be posted yet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think this is a good idea and I would be willing to help out, but for 
people like me to able to help out I guess I would need a list of 
subjects in advance, that way I could research my allocated subjects 
first. I'm fairly new to X2Go; my experience is with FreeNX so I need to 
learn X2Go better before writing anything :-)

I'll see if I can find some time to identify some subjects that either 
needs updating or new documentation, but where should I place this list? 
Could you start a wiki page Brian, where we could collaborate on the 
subjects?

Regards,
Terje
