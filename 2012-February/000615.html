<PRE>Hello Mike,

&gt;<i> I had a discussion with another of the developers (Alex) and we do
</I>&gt;<i> not know either, if there is a NX-builtin solution for just
</I>&gt;<i> listening on the localhost IP socket.
</I>
could this be considered as an important missing feature? I did not
find any way to put a feature request into a bugtracker, maybe you
would like to do this or forward this to anybody who is more familiar
with the development infrastructure? I am just an accidental by-alker
and would like to proceed with other things... THANKS!

&gt;<i> Our current recommendation is to use iptables, which you have to use
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, if your system runs in the public space somewhere.
</I>
Well, of course it is always possible to find a workaround - fixing
the source of the problem is a better approach.

x2go really looks like good quality software - but it is fair to say
that listening on all interfaces by default is not exactly known as
&quot;good behaviour&quot;.

I have no time invstigating deeper into this, but of course this
smells like &quot;easy remote exploit&quot; - I really would see this fixed ASAP
- and until it is not fixed it would be fair to put a big, red warning
on the website and instruct users about how to configure their
firewall until this problem is fixed - I bet there are many people not
even knowing about this issue.

Please do not wait until somebody else checks if this is a good way to
exploit an x2go server - hopefully it is NOT!

Thanks,
Bughunter
