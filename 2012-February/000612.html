PyHoca was also updated and now it won't load and gives me a message:

*pyhoca-gui[9111] (PyHoca-GUI) WARN: the current release of PyHoca-GUI does
not support client configuration
*
It did work before I updated this week.

To update I used the Ubuntu repository info from the x2go-wiki:

<A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:x2go-repository-ubuntu">http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:x2go-repository-ubuntu</A>

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable
$ sudo apt-get update

The x2goclient version is *3.99.0.6-0-144-oneiric*

As I'd mentioned my laptop hasn't been updated and it still connects fine
with both x2goclient &amp; pyhoca to the same server AND
on my desktop which was updated I CAN successfully connect to the server
using just SSH.

I tried to find some troubleshooting guide on the wiki that would at least
point to where log files might be but couldn't find anything.
If there are some troubleshooting steps posted somewhere for x2go I'll use
them to see if I can figure out what's going on.

thanks.   I have seen doing google searches that there are several posts in
the past of people using x2go that are posting the same error message.
Never saw anyone post an answer to those inquiries suggesting how or if
they fixed it.

Here are some of the other people that have posted the same error message
with their x2go (although not all are ubuntu based)   From the dates on
these posts
though I don't think they were using the same version of x2go ??

I have already tried the same steps Paul van der Vlis tried in the above
post dated in November 2011.

   - purging x2goclient from system &amp; reinstalling
   - tried connecting to a different x2goserver and it did not succeed
   (whereas Paul's did)

I *can* reach both of my x2go servers with ssh from this client and I can
reach BOTH of them from my laptop with the older x2goclient and pyhoca.

Here is another post of the same error.

thanks for any info or hints to troubleshoot this!    I'll cc Paul on this
to see if he ever uncovered the cause as his post was a couple months ago.
