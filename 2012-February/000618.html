<PRE>I wanted to make a suggestion to the x2go Community.

Everyone knows how fast and how much x2go has been changing in regards to
features, capabilities, etc.

Like most projects Documentation is hard to keep up with but to keep
growing the x2go Community as fast in the future as it has in the past year
or so I'd like to suggest the date for a week of focused x2go Wiki
updating/cleanup.

For success - it would take the commitment of both the x2go Community &amp; the
Core-Devs and some planning.    By that I mean try to come up with ways to
impact the core-dev team the least but maximize their knowledge of x2go
config, install, operation &amp; troubleshooting so the Community people can do
the actual editing of the Wiki.

Ideas:

   - identify &amp; input any missing information
   - all the FIX ME place-holders should be addressed
   - incorrect or out of date information should be updated or removed
   - add any new information that just hasn't found time to be posted yet
