<PRE>I haven't been able to figure out why my updated x2go is failing to allow
ssh login and start of my x2go session.

But I have figured out a workaround but it makes the question of what the
real problem is even stranger ?

*The workaround was to setup SSH Login Without Password Using ssh-keygen &amp;
ssh-copy-id*

For those that haven't done it before an easy/simple explanation of what
you have to do is found here:
<A HREF="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/">http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/</A>

for Ubuntu the instructions are here:
<A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys</A>

After doing this from your &quot;client&quot; system start the x2goclient and:

   1. create a new session
   2. select &quot;*session preferences*&quot; from the drop-down menu on your &quot;new
   session&quot; launcher icon
   3. check mark &quot;*Try auto login (ssh-agent or default ssh key)*&quot; option
   4. enter your Host address/dns name
   5. enter your login name
   6. click OK to save
   7. Click on the session Launcher ICON and now it should just autoconnect
   to your remote server with ssh and start your x2go session successfully


Now as to why the new x2goclient was failing and giving that message before
when the only difference is whether or not auto-login was used or x2go's
ssh key exchange ... I don't know.

The only thing I can think of is that there was some kind of &quot;key&quot; mismatch
between the server and the client before *which when I setup auto-login
would have been bypassed because the auto-login setup transfers a new RSA
key to make sure they match between machines.
*
Anyway setting up auto-login now lets x2goclient start the session
successfully !! &lt;g&gt;

I have this problem on 2 older machines, and not on other machines.
I have tried much to get rit of this problem, but with no success.

Interesting is that I can use pyhoca-gui without problems where
X2goclient failes. But the last time I've tried this I had a problem
with Pyhoca-gui: the keyboard did not work fine over the session. It did
work, but often there where key-presses missing.  Over another direct
SSH connection typing was no problem.

With regards,
Paul.
