<PRE>Hello all,

Long time user of NX related programs for some time now.  Mostly freenx, 
which has been driving me crazy lately.  I am a staunch Debian user and 
feel that it's unlikely that freenx will ever enter main there.  Hence 
my want to switch to X2Go.  I've been following and trying to get this 
working for me too long now.  The largest hurdle that is stopping me now 
is the inability to switch windows properly when using the windows X2Go 
client.

I keep a long running session open on a remote box and prefer to keep 
most of my work there.  The problem is that I also have a need to switch 
back to my local desktop often.  Typically I do this with the &quot;magic&quot; 
pixel or Alt + Tab.  I'm also perhaps quirky in that I want my remote 
session to be full screen not windowed.

I do not experience this problem from a Linux laptop with X2Go or 
PyHoca-Gui.  I can switch windows, suspend, resume, et. al. just dandy!  
My problem is with the M$ side of course.  Starting the session is fine, 
even resuming one started elsewhere.  When I switch back to another 
program though I can't get back to my session properly.  Either I will 
see part of my desktop (KDE if it matters) and the last program I was 
using in windows will be covering the rest.  Sometimes if I minimize 
that program I will get my remote session back, not often though.

Typically what happens is I will get a small rectangle toward the upper 
left of my windows desktop.  It may or may not have the minimize, 
restore, close widget displayed with it.  When this happens the only way 
back to my remote session is to close the client and reconnect.  This 
does work, far too painful to deal with.

Seems that I have just been babbling here.  If I can describe it some 
other way, post logs, config, whatever I am willing to do that.  A quick 
kick in the right direction would be appreciated.  Server logs show 
nothing at any debug level that I see.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Mike
