<PRE>Terje lets you and I work on this together.

Email me directly and we can figure out how best to collaborate on the
initial definition of what needs to be done on the Wiki then
we can present a draft to the x2go user community and obtain volunteers to
work on specific sections.

Thanks
Brian Mullan

set a date for a Week of Wiki updating/cleanup
Hi Brian,

Den 19. feb. 2012 17:17, skrev brian mullan:

I wanted to make a suggestion to the x2go Community.

Everyone knows how fast and how much x2go has been changing in regards to
features, capabilities, etc.

Like most projects Documentation is hard to keep up with but to keep
growing the x2go Community as fast in the future as it has in the past year
or so I'd like to suggest the date for a week of focused x2go Wiki
updating/cleanup.

For success - it would take the commitment of both the x2go Community &amp; the
Core-Devs and some planning.    By that I mean try to come up with ways to
impact the core-dev team the least but maximize their knowledge of x2go
config, install, operation &amp; troubleshooting so the Community people can do
the actual editing of the Wiki.

Ideas:

   - identify &amp; input any missing information
   - all the FIX ME place-holders should be addressed
   - incorrect or out of date information should be updated or removed
   - add any new information that just hasn't found time to be posted yet


I think this is a good idea and I would be willing to help out, but for
people like me to able to help out I guess I would need a list of subjects
in advance, that way I could research my allocated subjects first. I'm
fairly new to X2Go; my experience is with FreeNX so I need to learn X2Go
better before writing anything :-)

I'll see if I can find some time to identify some subjects that either
needs updating or new documentation, but where should I place this list?
Could you start a wiki page Brian, where we could collaborate on the
subjects?

Regards,
Terje
