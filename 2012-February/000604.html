First Thank you Mike and John for the response.  I've narrowed this down 
a bit more.  My longshot hunch is that this lies with vcxsrv and not 
X2Go client.  I forgot to mention that the problem windows machine is 
Vista Home Premium SP2.  I pulled out a XP Home SP3 machine that is 
heading out and put 3.99.1.0 preview2 on that.  Disabled all sound, 
tunnels, sharing etc.  it works as it should.  The Vista machine still 
experience the same crap, no love for me...  Finally in a near fit I 
disabled nearly all the extra fluff that Vista comes with enabled.  Aero 
(or whatever their 3d junk is) isn't supported on this box anyway, all 
the other wiz bang options are now disabled.  Now I have a Vista that 
looks like XP and all the sudden X2Go works a charm.  I've lost the 
magic pixel, but alt + tab will switch me out and back to my session.  
Every machine that I've tried thus far will resume / suspend just 
dandy.   Most excellent!

Now maybe I'll go dust off the old iBook and see if a client will fire 
up on PPC.

Haven't tested PyHoca-GUI but I'm sure it will work now.  If I can 
narrow down more what the problem is I'll post a reply to this for the 
archives.  Still a rather strange problem.
