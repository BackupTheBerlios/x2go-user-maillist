<PRE>John, 

I've tried without tunneling: it is working! But in my case there is
a firewall between client and server. Does somebody know which ports
are used? What I found out so far is that the client is listening on
port 4713tcp. So my ruleset right now has ssh in one direction and
4713 in the other. Will the ports change if you have more then one
client or with a new connection? Can it be configured
somewhere?

Regards
Frank

</I>&gt;<i> working. If you select another video flash seems to wait for something. If
</I>&gt;<i> you try to exit/close firefox you have to wait some seconds. Do you have any
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions what may cause this? With a local login everything works for at
</I>&gt;<i> last ten minutes so I&#160; assume it is no problem with the server.

Have you tried UNchecking &quot;use SSD port forwarding to tunnel sound
system connections through firewalls&quot;?

I've found that sound tunneling is broken on all windows x2goclients
after 3.01-13. If I disable the sound tunneling on the later clients,
then videos and sound play fine. If I enable it, the videos and sound
do not play (they just freeze). Of course, my x2go connection is not
going through a firewall.
