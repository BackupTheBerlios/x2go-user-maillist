</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Debian user and feel that it's unlikely that freenx will ever enter  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; main there.  Hence my want to switch to X2Go.  I've been following  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and trying to get this working for me too long now.  The largest  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hurdle that is stopping me now is the inability to switch windows  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly when using the windows X2Go client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I keep a long running session open on a remote box and prefer to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keep most of my work there.  The problem is that I also have a need  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to switch back to my local desktop often.  Typically I do this with  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;magic&quot; pixel or Alt + Tab.  I'm also perhaps quirky in that I  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want my remote session to be full screen not windowed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not experience this problem from a Linux laptop with X2Go or  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PyHoca-Gui.  I can switch windows, suspend, resume, et. al. just  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dandy!  My problem is with the M$ side of course.  Starting the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session is fine, even resuming one started elsewhere.  When I switch  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back to another program though I can't get back to my session  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly.  Either I will see part of my desktop (KDE if it matters)  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the last program I was using in windows will be covering the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rest.  Sometimes if I minimize that program I will get my remote  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session back, not often though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Typically what happens is I will get a small rectangle toward the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upper left of my windows desktop.  It may or may not have the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; minimize, restore, close widget displayed with it.  When this  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happens the only way back to my remote session is to close the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client and reconnect.  This does work, far too painful to deal with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seems that I have just been babbling here.  If I can describe it  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some other way, post logs, config, whatever I am willing to do that.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  A quick kick in the right direction would be appreciated.  Server  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logs show nothing at any debug level that I see.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any help is greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @John Sullivan or maybe Stefan Baur: do you have any experience with  
</I>&gt;<i> this??? A contribution is much appreciated!

Hi, Mike, et al.  I do have issues with the way the Windows client
handles keyboard grabbing.  I tend to work exactly as the posting Mike
describes and would prefer that &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; worked within the virtual
desktop and that either or both the magic pixel and keyboard shortcuts
(&lt;CTL&gt;M, &lt;CTL&gt;F) worked but I do not have this issue.  I have seen what
Mike describes but it is usually a network communications issue - very
high latency or packet loss and happens on Linux as well as Windows.
Hope that helps - John
