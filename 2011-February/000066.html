</I>&gt;<i> - the remote desktop window does not show up at all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On both occasions I'm connectiong with same creditials. I'm not using

</I>&gt;<i> I really hope that we can solve this strange problem together.
</I>&gt;<i> _&lt;snip&gt;
</I>Just a quick thought.  Is there any chance root is using bash and
regular users are using dash as their shell? I know very little about
Arch but, until the X2Go Server side scripts specify /bin/bash instead
of /bin/sh, they will fail on dash shells. Good luck - John
