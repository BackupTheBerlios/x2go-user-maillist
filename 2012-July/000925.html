</I>It's a problem on the client side.  That's why changing the port to be
different on one host from another host fixes the problem.

However, it was not always this way.  The older clients (e.g., 3.0.1-4)
accidentally supported multiple connections without having to fiddle
with the server settings.

We would very much like to see a reversion to the old behavior.  We have
been pushing the concept of Content Networks, i.e., rather than have a
single computer in which one tries to shoe horn all one's activities,
have multiple virtual desktops for major, e.g., engineering firms
providing outsourced services to multiple firms, PR and advertising firm
with account managers handling multiple accounts - wherever intensive
collaboration needs to happen across corporate boundaries.

Not being able to run multiple X2Go clients with default server settings
is a real pain for us.  Thanks for pointing it out - John
