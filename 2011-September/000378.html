I use up-to-date Debian Squeeze with Gnome and this X2go repository:
deb <A HREF="http://packages.x2go.org/debian">http://packages.x2go.org/debian</A> squeeze main

I did some tests with Pyhoca-GUI this morning and I saw some crashes of
a session.

1. I opened Epiphany and another Window was opened asking me for a
password for Gnome keyring. I entered the password and clicked OK. Then
there was a session-crash.

2. I opened OpenOffice Writer without document (3.2.1) a few times full
screen and closed it. After 4 tries the session crashed.

3. I did OpenOffice test again. And after 5 tries it crashed.

4. I did the OpenOffice test again, but after 20 tries no crash. Then I
opened a terminal windows and did the OpenOffice test again. Then a
crash. During the other test I had also an terminal window open (no
other programs).

5. I tried again with an open terminal window (Gnome terminal 2.30.2
from Debian stable) and did the OpenOffice test. After 5 tries the
session crashed.

6. I tried again with an open terminal window. After 9 tries the session
crashed.

Interesting to tell is maybe, that after restoring the session there was
no terminal in the session anymore. So I think it's a crash on the
server-side. The connection was not lost, only the session.

The server is an older normal Intel PC (32-bits, 1 core). The client is
a newer AMD-based PC (64-bits, 4 cores).

I also tried the same with the same client to a Lenny server what uses
this repository:
deb <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A> lenny main
I did the openoffice test (OOo 2.4 from Lenny) with a terminal but it
did not crash in 20 tries.

I also tried it with the same client to another server with Squeeze. I
saw there a crash too while closing OpenOffice (after 8 times). This is
a stronger server (Xeon 2 cores, Intel server mainboard). Here I saw an
excisting session in Pyhoca-GUI, but it was not possible to resume it.

With regards,
Paul
