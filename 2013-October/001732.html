</I>
I spent some time testing several versions of the Windows client, and
I can confirm the behavior you mention, and add a few more versions:

Note that the problem is somewhat intermittent. Waiting a few hours to
resume a session makes it more likely to hang during connection, but
it does not always hang. So I spent some time with each version,
repeatedly trying to resume sesssions, sometimes immediately,
sometimes after the session has been suspended for hours. When I say
it &quot;works&quot; I mean that I never got it to hang. When I say that it
hangs, I mean that it hung at least once (usually more than once,
though).

Linux server:
x2go-agent 3.5.0.21
x2goserver 4.0.1.6

Windows client:
3.99.2.1 filename (3.99.2.2 about box): works
3.99.3.1-pre1_interims (old pulseaudio): hangs
4.0.0.3: hangs
4.0.0.3_interims (old pulseaudio): hangs
4.0.1.0-pre02 : hangs

So it appears that this issue was introduced between
3.99.2.1(3.99.2.2) and 3.99.3.1-pre1. Also, it does NOT appear to be a
consequence of the new pulseaudio version, since the old interims
version has the same issue.

Perhaps the program maintainer can check the changelog between then
and deduce what is causing the intermittent hang during connection
issue.
