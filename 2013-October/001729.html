<PRE>Hi All:

Am trying to get up to speed on x2go session broker, but am having 
trouble.  Any suggestions?

When try to connect I get:

Error
Login failed!
Please try again.

Along with...
broker url: <A HREF="http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/:8080/plain/inifilebroker">http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/:8080/plain/inifilebroker</A> 
url:<A HREF="http://xxx.xxxx.xxx.xxx/:8080/plain/inifile">http://xxx.xxxx.xxx.xxx/:8080/plain/inifile</A>

or....
broker url:<A HREF="http://user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/x2gobroker.cfgi">http://user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/x2gobroker.cfgi</A>

As I'm getting started, I'm trying to do this on my LAN (all behind my 
firewall) without any ssh (longer term I want to see if I can run 
sessions inside SSL).  I've disabled all the iptable rules on my 
server....and tried various settings in the x2gobroker.conf and 
x2gobroker-sessionprofiles.conf files which have not really changed the 
error message but may be the problem (see below).

I can connect using the x2go client GUI &quot;the normal way&quot;, and the first 
time I got a window on the client &quot;The server is unknown.  Do you trust 
the host key....&quot;, which I assume is x2go dynamically creating a ssh 
tunnel?  This part works fine.

However, when I try from the command line with an &quot;x2goclient 
--broker-...&quot; type of command, I get the Error message.

Both client and server are running Debian Squeeze, and on the server 
I've successively installed:
x2gobroker-wsgi
apache2
libapache20mod-wsgi
x2gobroker-authservice (wasn't sure if I should install this for my 
initial tests)

My x2gobroker.conf:

# X2Go's authorized_keys file for broker mediated autologin sessions
#
# For the X2Go auto-login via X2Go Session Broker feature to work 
thoroughly,
# the X2Go Session Broker has to place the temporary public SSH key into the
# user's home
directory. It is not recommended to use SSH's default
# authorized_keys file for this but a separate and X2Go-specific 
authorized_keys
# file ($HOME/.x2go/authorized_keys).
#
# Of course, the SSH daemon has to be made aware of this. This can be 
configured
# in /etc/ssh/sshd_config like this:
#
#    --- /etc/ssh/sshd_config.no-x2go        2013-03-01

# X2Go Broker Agent query mode
#
# The X2Go Broker Agent is needed for multi-server sites configured for
# load balancing. Multi-server sites require a setup that uses the
# PostgreSQL X2Go session DB backend. The X2Go Broker Agent has to be 
installed
# on the local system (mode: LOCAL) or on all X2Go Servers (mode: SSH) in a
# multi-server farm.
#
# So, there are three query modes for the X2GO Broker Agent: NONE, LOCAL and
# SSH.
#
#    NONE  - Try to get along without X2Go Broker Agent queries. For simple
#            broker setups this may suffice. For load-balancing or reliable
#            session suspending and resuming the broker agent is a must!!!
#
#    LOCAL - This LOCAL mode only works for _one_ configured 
multi-server farm.
#            If this X2Go Session Broker is supposed to serve many different
#            multi-server farms, then the LOCAL mode will not work!!!
#
#            How it works: Assume that the local system has an X2Go 
Broker Agent
#            that knows about the multi-server setup. This means: X2Go 
Server
#            has to be installed locally and the X2Go Server has to be
#            configured to use the multi-server farm's PostgreSQL session DB
#            backend.
#
#            The local system that is running the broker does not 
necessarily
#            have to be a real application server. It only has to be 
aware of
#            running/suspended sessions within the X2Go multi-server 
farm setup.
#
#            A typical use-case is X2Go on top of a Debian Edu 
Terminal-Server
#            farm:
#
#              TJENER -&gt; PostgreSQL DB, X2Go Server, X2Go Session Broker +
#                  Broker Agent
#              TS01 - TS0X -&gt; X2Go Server configured to use the 
PostgreSQL DB
#                  on TJENER
#
#    SSH   - The more generic approach, but also more complex. It allows 
that
#            the broker on this system may serve for many different X2Go 
Server
#            multi-server setups.
#
#            With the SSH agent query mode, the X2Go Session Broker will 
query
#            one of the X2Go Servers in the targeted multi-server setup 
(through
#            SSH). The SSH authentication is done by a system user account
#            (normally UID=x2gobroker) and SSH pub/priv key 
authentication has
#            to be configured to make this work.
#
#            All X2Go Servers in a multi-server farm need the X2Go 
Broker Agent
#            installed, whereas this local system running the X2Go Session
#            Broker does not need a local X2Go Broker Agent at all.
#
# The agent query mode can be configured on a per-broker-backend basis, the
# below value is the default.
#default-agent-query-mode=LOCAL

###
### BACKEND section
###

# Possible X2Go Session Broker backends:
#
# 1. backend = zeroconf (activated by default)
# Use the ZeroConf X2Go Session Broker backend, this backend is for demo 
only
# and only operates on localhost. Make sure you have x2gobroker-daemon and
# and x2goserver installed on the same machine. No need to install
# x2gobroker-agent.

# 2. backend = infile (deactivated by default)
# The IniFile X2Go Session Broker backend is for providing session profiles
# to multiple users/clients on a text config file basis (.ini file format).
#
# The session profile setup is accomplished by an extra configuration file,
# by default named /etc/x2go/broker/x2gobroker-sessionproiles.conf.
#
# For small-scale deployments the IniFile backend is the recommended 
backend.

My x2gobroker-sessionprofiles.conf:
### X2Go Broker Session Profiles - ADAPT TO YOUR NEEDS ###

# This whole file reflects a set of examplary X2Go session profiles being
# provided via the X2Go Session Broker (backend: iniconf).

# This whole file could be the broker setup in some university institute 
that
# runs three server pools (pool-A, pool-B and pool-C). Though most 
univerities
# have real IPv4 internet addresses, we use private subnets in the examples
# below.

# The X2Go Session Broker is served into the institutes local intranet, the
# broker cannot be reached from the internet directly.

# The first section [DEFAULTS] provides a set of default profile 
settings that
# are common to all session profiles given in sections below.

# The other section names can be freely chosen, however, each section 
name has
# to be unique within this file.

# IMPORTANT: in the session profiles below you will find some lines starting
# with acl-... These lines do neither protect the X2Go Session Broker nor
# your X2Go Servers. They simply allow for selective session profile 
provision
# based on client address, user name and group memberships.
#
# For protecting the broker use iptables and ip6tables. For protecting your
# X2Go Servers use iptable+ip6tables and a tightened PAM configuration (e.g.
# pam_access.so). Securing X2Go Servers means securing the SSH daemon that
# runs on the X2Go Server.
