<PRE>Hello,



I am trying to set up an x2go server with thin clients (debian wheezy).
For the most part, the clients are working fine - the boot time and
speed is astonishing even with the low-power server hardware I need to
use.



Alas, there are a few important things I cannot get to work after days
of googling and tinkering:



1) mounting local drives on the thin clients

- When I insert a cd-rom, a little eject button appears in the lower
right corner of the screen. However, I cannot see the files on the disc
in /home/&lt;user&gt;/media/cd

- When I insert a FAT formatted USB stick, nothing (visible) happens.
Only in the local console can I see that a device has been attached,
but nothing is mounted, and nothing shows up in /home/&lt;user&gt;/media/disk



The x2gousbmount and x2gocdmanager are installed in the chroot, and
&lt;user&gt; was added to the fuse group. Are there other prerequisite
packages on the server that I could have missed?



2) Sound on the thin clients doesn't work

- upon PXE boot, the sound card seems to be correctly detected; I
checked alsamixer. Pulse connects correctly via TCP, but pactl lists no
sound card. It seems that module-udev-detect fails to detect the sound
card. I don't know how to get debug output because I cannot find where
the actual command line (pulseaudio -D -n -L module-native-protocol-tcp
[...] ) is generated in the chroot to add more debug output



PulseAudio Manager reports &quot;Default Sink: not set&quot;; &quot;Default Source:
not set&quot;.



Those issues are real showstoppers for a project I am trying to set up
in Africa next week - I'd be really thankful for hints on how to solve
them.



Peter
