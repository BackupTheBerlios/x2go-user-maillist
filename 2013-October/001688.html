</I>

I have had the same problem on Windows client versions 4.0.1.0 and
4.0.0.3 for quite a while now. There does NOT appear to be a Windows
binary version 4.0.1.1 available for download.

One thing that usually works is to restart the server process (I am
running the systemd x2goserver 4.0.1.6-1). Then I will be able to
resume a session that previously hung the windows client.

Another odd thing that I have noticed with the Windows client is that
sometimes when I click on a session, it brings up the dialog box
showing a suspended session, but the resume button is greyed out and
does not respond. Still, I can double-click on the session line in the
list and it tries to resume, but it will often hang if it has been
suspended for several hours (same behavior you noted). Then I restart
x2goserver.service, and I can resume the session.
