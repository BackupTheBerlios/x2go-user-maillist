Windows x2goclient 3.99.0.0 is working for me at the moment on 64-bit
Windows 7. I just installed it a few minutes ago, and I did have a
slight snag at first but it seems to have disappeared (not sure if it
is the same issue Daniel saw).

My server has (I think) x2goserver 3.0.1-5, from here:

<A HREF="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=18028">http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=18028</A>

I am testing on two Windows client machines, both running 64-bit
Windows 7. Call them CL1 and CL2.

CL1 was initially running x2goclient 3.01-13, and had a session in
progress. I installed 3.99 on CL2 (initially without vcxsrv), and
started a new session (all my sessions are LXDE), which worked well
for the minute I had it open. Then I logged out of the CL2 session,
and suspended the CL1 session. Then I tried to resume the suspended
session on CL2, but it froze during attempted connection, nothing at
all happened for more than a minute, so I aborted and restarted the
client on CL2. Then I resumed the suspended session on CL1 (CL1 was
still client 3.01-13), and it worked. Then on CL2 I started a new
session, and that worked. So I logged out of the session on CL2,
suspended the session on CL1 once again, and tried to resume the
session on CL2. Success! It came right up on CL2 with the 3.99 client.
After a minute, I suspended the session again.

Next I tested with vcxsrv 1.10.3.1. I used the installer to install
vcxsrv on CL2 into 'Program Files (x86)', and then went into
Settings... for x2goclient and specified to use vcxsrv. Note that the
default looked for vcxsrv.exe in 'Program Files' instead of 'Program
Files (x86)', but it was easy to change that.

I resumed the session on CL2 and it worked. So I suspended the session
and resumed the session on CL1 (3.01-13), and that worked. So I
suspended the session again, and on CL1 I installed vcxsrv and
x2goclient 3.99, and resumed the session on CL1 again, and it worked.
I have been running it on CL1 for about 30 minutes now, and no
problems yet. I'll keep running it (I use CL1 every day) so if you do
not hear from me for a while, that means I haven't had any problems. I
will, of course, post about any problems that I might have. So
hopefully you don't hear from me for a while!
