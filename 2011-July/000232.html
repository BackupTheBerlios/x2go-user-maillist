Good question; sorry for leaving that bit out.  My current test
environment is 32 bit Windows XP.  We have another user testing 64 bit
Windows 7.  Most of the complaining users are 32 bit Windows XP.

The disappearing mouse pointer is an Xming bug.  Moving to vcxsrv will
solve that.  I think 3.0.1.14 was the first to support that but I'm not
sure.

We are also using an old X2Go Server - 3.0.1-5 I believe.  Thanks - John
