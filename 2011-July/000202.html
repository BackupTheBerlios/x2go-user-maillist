<PRE>Thank you to the developers for make this excellent software.

Many people at my work use x2go's Mac client. We have never been able
to figure out how to resolve the 'Can't connect to X-Server' error
without random acts (eg. rebooting). We are not sure why it comes up.

This is what I do:
1. Start X11.app
2. ssh -X remotehost
3. xterm &amp;

So far this works, I get an xterm so there is nothing wrong with X11

4. Start X2Go client
5. Start a session (port 22, dsa authentication, Gnome...)

6. Client gives the error and hangs (Abort and Terminate don't do
anything) and I have to close the application.

The closest we got to figuring it out is that the X11.app possibly
changes it's DISPLAY on restarts and perhaps the x2go client is
expecting display 0. Is there any more debugging information that I
could get from the client to see what exactly it is doing prior to
giving the error message?

We have tried some of the suggestions in the forums, such as changing
permissions in X11.app (this is necessary), starting it manually
before starting the client. We have also done things like messed with
firewall settings, made sure hostname doesn't change on our laptops
between work and home, deleted preference files, delete XAuthority
files, etc. What seems to work is rebooting.

Thanks,
P&#229;l
