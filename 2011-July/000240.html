<PRE>Hi John,

&gt;<i> Ah, got it.  I like that approach and much that I saw in Pyhoca -

</I>
Not so on Linux. I guess it is also the wxPython stuff for Windows. On  
Linux wxPython wraps around GTK2+. The performance is pretty normal.

I suppose the long startup of PyHoca-GUI on Windows relates to the way  
the Python code is shipped (py2exe has been used to create a  
PyHoca-GUI that does not require a locally installed Python).

&gt;<i> To deal with the primary thread subject, I was at first hopeful that the
</I>&gt;<i> screen painting pause was solved as I was able to work for quite a while
</I>&gt;<i> without the problem appearing but, eventually it did. So all platforms
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested so far have this crippling problem.
</I>
What x2goagent version are you using on the server-side??? We have a  
3.5.0.2 version at hand that has a lot of stuff solved.

I have recently also backported all server-side packages that are  
currently hosted in the new X2go Git to Debian lenny.

Summarized: every observation you make with the session screen itself  
is a NXv3 issue. That is

   server:
   -------
   libxcomp3
   libxcompext3
   libxcompshad3
   x2goagent (which is a nxagent 3.5.0-1 fork)

   client:
   -------
   libxcomp3
   nxproxy


&gt;<i> I did notice a few strange things about Pyhoca itself. I also hit the 17
</I>&gt;<i> bit pixel depth problem.
</I>
It seems that some Windows desktops report 17bit depth when they use  
16bit. I'll keep this in mind the next time I look at the color depth  
stuff...

&gt;<i> Response time to the one local LAN server I have was abysmal - utterly
</I>&gt;<i> unusable and much slower than the WAN based servers.  It was literally
</I>&gt;<i> click and wait ten to twenty seconds.  I thought this might be because
</I>&gt;<i> of full screen versus windowed but changing that did not help.  I then
</I>&gt;<i> thought it might be because I had set the connection to LAN.  I tried
</I>&gt;<i> setting it to DSL but then hit my next problem.
</I>
This has been the complete time that you were connected? Or only after  
a while?

&gt;<i> Suddenly, all the images became completely corrupt.  I tried reverting
</I>&gt;<i> to the regulat 3.0.1.18 X2Go client but it also displayed all images as
</I>&gt;<i> completely corrupt.  They are not when connecting from my Linux based
</I>&gt;<i> X2Go Client.  I still have not fixed this problem on Windows.  Here is
</I>&gt;<i> the long list of things I tried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rebooting my physical computer rather than simply closing Pyhoca and
</I>&gt;<i> opening X2Goclient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearing all the session information on the client.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearing all the session information on the server.
</I>&gt;<i> Deleting the 17 bit cache directory on the client.
</I>&gt;<i> Deleting all cache directories on the client.
</I>&gt;<i> Rebooting the server.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearing all the cache directories on the server and rebooting.
</I>&gt;<i> Uninstalling Pyhoca (after which X2Go client complained it could not
</I>&gt;<i> start the X server)
</I>&gt;<i> Uninstalling and reinstalling vcxsrv.
</I>&gt;<i> Uninstalling and reinstalling x2goclient 3.0.1.18
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None of those solved the image corruption problem; I am currently unable
</I>&gt;<i> to use X2goclient in Windows.
</I>
Ihhhhh.... This is yukkie... Have never had that before...

&gt;<i> I also noticed that Pyhoca only had jpeg packing.  We have found the
</I>&gt;<i> 16m-png-jpeg packing has generally given us substantially better
</I>&gt;<i> performance and clarity.
</I>
Ah... Ok. Good point. I will put that on my todo list. Should be quite  
simple to add that...

&gt;<i> Thanks - John
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for your feedback, unfortuntely not being of much help with out  
issues...
Mike
