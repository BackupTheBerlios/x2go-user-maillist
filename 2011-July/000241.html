</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, got it.  I like that approach and much that I saw in Pyhoca -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including still being able to open multiple sessions.  The application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itself seemed much, much slower but I suppose that is the difference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between Python and C++.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not so on Linux. I guess it is also the wxPython stuff for Windows. On  
</I>&gt;<i> Linux wxPython wraps around GTK2+. The performance is pretty normal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose the long startup of PyHoca-GUI on Windows relates to the way  
</I>&gt;<i> the Python code is shipped (py2exe has been used to create a  
</I>&gt;<i> PyHoca-GUI that does not require a locally installed Python).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To deal with the primary thread subject, I was at first hopeful that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screen painting pause was solved as I was able to work for quite a while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without the problem appearing but, eventually it did. So all platforms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've tested so far have this crippling problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What x2goagent version are you using on the server-side??? We have a  
</I>&gt;<i> 3.5.0.2 version at hand that has a lot of stuff solved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently also backported all server-side packages that are  
</I>&gt;<i> currently hosted in the new X2go Git to Debian lenny.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Summarized: every observation you make with the session screen itself  
</I>&gt;<i> is a NXv3 issue. That is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    server:
</I>&gt;<i>    -------
</I>&gt;<i>    libxcomp3
</I>&gt;<i>    libxcompext3
</I>&gt;<i>    libxcompshad3
</I>&gt;<i>    x2goagent (which is a nxagent 3.5.0-1 fork)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    client:
</I>&gt;<i>    -------
</I>&gt;<i>    libxcomp3
</I>&gt;<i>    nxproxy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Excellent! We are using an older version so I will try upgrading those.

&gt;<i> &gt; I did notice a few strange things about Pyhoca itself. I also hit the 17
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit pixel depth problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that some Windows desktops report 17bit depth when they use  
</I>&gt;<i> 16bit. I'll keep this in mind the next time I look at the color depth  
</I>&gt;<i> stuff...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Response time to the one local LAN server I have was abysmal - utterly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unusable and much slower than the WAN based servers.  It was literally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; click and wait ten to twenty seconds.  I thought this might be because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of full screen versus windowed but changing that did not help.  I then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought it might be because I had set the connection to LAN.  I tried
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setting it to DSL but then hit my next problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has been the complete time that you were connected? Or only after  
</I>&gt;<i> a while?
</I>Complete time I was connected.
