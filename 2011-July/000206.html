<PRE>Paul,

Unfortunately as a regular user of the Mac X2go client, this is something
I've seen many times. Unfortunately, I haven't found any fix for it. The
good news is that it rarely happens if you keep the X11 application open.
Always open X11 before starting your X2go session. From there, you can
stop/start X2go sessions, even the X2go client itself, however I almost
always keep my X11 app running even when it's not being uses and then I
don't get the problem you are describing. If I quit X11, especially if it's
accidental during an active X2go session, then I end up with the problem you
are describing and the only option is to restart the whole computer. But if
I keep it open, I go for days or weeks without rebooting.

Ultimately, I think we should look to move to the PyHoca gui, but we haven't
been able to find any serious python developers to port it to OS X.

Neil

Thank you to the developers for make this excellent software.

Many people at my work use x2go's Mac client. We have never been able
to figure out how to resolve the 'Can't connect to X-Server' error
without random acts (eg. rebooting). We are not sure why it comes up.

This is what I do:
1. Start X11.app
2. ssh -X remotehost
3. xterm &amp;

So far this works, I get an xterm so there is nothing wrong with X11

4. Start X2Go client
5. Start a session (port 22, dsa authentication, Gnome...)

6. Client gives the error and hangs (Abort and Terminate don't do
anything) and I have to close the application.

The closest we got to figuring it out is that the X11.app possibly
changes it's DISPLAY on restarts and perhaps the x2go client is
expecting display 0. Is there any more debugging information that I
could get from the client to see what exactly it is doing prior to
giving the error message?

We have tried some of the suggestions in the forums, such as changing
permissions in X11.app (this is necessary), starting it manually
before starting the client. We have also done things like messed with
firewall settings, made sure hostname doesn't change on our laptops
between work and home, deleted preference files, delete XAuthority
files, etc. What seems to work is rebooting.

Thanks,
P?l
