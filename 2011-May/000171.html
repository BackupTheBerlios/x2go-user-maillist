<PRE>Hello, all.  We were very eager to experiment with TSPlus
(<A HREF="http://www.tsplus.net">http://www.tsplus.net</A>) as an alternative to Microsoft RDS.  We have
been assuming all along that performance of any RDP solution is better
in a low bandwidth WAN environment if we put X2Go in the middle of it
and run rdesktop from the X2Go Server to a local Windows server.  Our
results were very disappointing with both TSPlus and RDS and with both
rdesktop and xfreerdp.

Has anyone else experienced the same poor performance or, more
importantly, has anyone worked around it?

We noticed that screens seemed to be painting line by line - not sure if
if it is the entire screen or just the active window.  It also made
mouse movements very erratic in TSPlus + rdesktop.  TSPlus + xfreerdp
seems better.

To demonstrate this, I opened notepad in a large window in a full screen
session, typed an entire line, copied it to the clipboard and then held
down &lt;CTL&gt;V to paste it.  The first few lines flew but then it became
very slow and we could see the flicker of each line painting.

I also opened Internet Explorer and went to www.spiritualoutreach.org -
a very poorly designed site I put up years ago with long pages and far
too large graphics.  I sat and watched the screen paint a band at a
time.  I opened one of the large template documents and vertical
scrolling was nearly impossible.

I'll paste in some of our internal notes below.  Thanks - John



BEGIN NOTES
Good afternoon, Phil.  I've dropped an unexpected several hours into
this this morning with some good, some bad news, and some inconclusive
news.  There is an alternative to rdesktop named freerdp which aims to
implement the newer protocols as rdesktop is barely being developed.
Last I used it, it was very lacking but I installed the current Squeeze
version on my netbook and connected to windesk01 across the VPN
(xfreerdp -d mydomain -u myid -a 32 -x lan -f --plugin cliprdr
tsplusserver ).  The results were stunning.

Performance was quite usable directly through the VPN, i.e, not using
X2Go as an intermediary.  The silly test I was using to see the line by
line painting (opening a large notepad, typing a full line, copying it
to the clipboard, and then holding down &lt;CTL&gt;V to continually paste it)
worked quite well.  I did the same thing to RDSServer where I had some
large architectural drawing stashed and they scrolled largely
seamlessly.

I then returned to my VD, installed freerdp-x11, and tried the same.
The results were most disappointing - the same problems of slow, line by
line painting.  I also noticed that the full screen toggle
(&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;) mangled whereas directly on the VPN, it did not.  I
wonder of there is some sort of conflict between the way NX and RDP
paint the screen?

I then tried the same thing using simply rdesktop.  The performance over
the VPN was better than I remembered.  I also contrasted RDSServer and
tsplusserver.  I'm not sure but it is possible that TSPlus is actually
getting heat for something they are doing well.  The line by line screen
painting in my notepad test was much more noticeable in TSPlus but the
overall performance was about the same.  I wonder if TSPlus is painting
the screen faster and so we see the repaints whereas RDS is hiding them
by not updating the screen as quickly. I don't know - just a thought.

I'm continuing to play around with this quite a bit.  In fact the above
paragraph was typed from a direct full screen Windows desktop via X2Go.
This paragraph is being typed across the VPN directly on tsplusserver
using xfreerdp.  The keyboard response seems about the same.

For kicks, I opened KWrite on my Trinity desktop and tried the same
pasting test to see if the screen painting was line by line.  It was
not; it flew.  So it is something in the interaction between RDP and NX.

To create the X2Go direct Windows session, create new sessions (one for
tsplusserver and the other for RDSServer).  The type should be Custom
Desktop (NOT single application) with the command line as described
above).  Remember to set the compression type to 16m-png-jpeg and the
display DPI.  I'll be very curious to see what you see.
END NOTES
