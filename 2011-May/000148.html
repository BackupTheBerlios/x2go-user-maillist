<PRE>Hi, Mike,


thanx for your answer - and sorry, I actually forgot the reminder on the Mailman-website regarding the language ... by the way: a bit strange since X2go is as well a german-based project (as far as I can see) as the main part of information on the web is in german, too ... ;-) but there may not be enough interest for a standalone german-list.


a brief conclusion (Mike, you got it fairly good!):

- we are working on a (professional) project with server-based computing. The main interest is to supersede Microsofts RDP and Nomachines NX.
- we tried X2Go with the Installation-documents from www.x2go.org on different virtual machines (Debian Lenny, Squeeze, Ubuntu) - the installation is more or less straightforward, but the documentation is unfortunately full of errors. But it *is* possible to get X2go to work on the serverside - and the LDAP-scripts are very good (so far as we can see)!
- but none of the clients we tried worked :-( We tried those for MacOS on an 10.5.6-Intel-System, for Windows on a XP-System, and finally two clients for Ubuntu (x2goclient and x2goclient-gtk). It all results in more or less meaningful errormessages, crashes of the appliance and tine-outs on the client :-(

We have *not* yet tested the Webclient and the Netboot-Environment.


&gt;<i> Mike: I personally use X2go productively as a system administrator. In  
</I>&gt;<i> all networks I administrate there is one desktop workstation that runs  
</I>&gt;<i> x2goserver. I use GNOME or LXDE to access the network components from  
</I>&gt;<i> this X2go server. I install x2goserver from the new squeeze repos and  
</I>&gt;<i> everything works out of the box (sqlite). As clients I use x2gocleint
</I>
Sounds good! As we are documenting all the steps we execute in test-environments - do you have a (working! ;-)) step-by-step-documentation for, lets say, Squeeze?

Oh, of course: I could send you our three documentations (Debian Squeeze / Debian Lenny / Ubuntu) where we have written down all the errors and broken links and strange behaviours we have experienced with x2go. 


&gt;<i> I also work for a company in the Netherlands that uses X2go for  
</I>&gt;<i> full-featured SaaS.
</I>
So there may be hope ... ;-)


&gt;<i> TRANSLATED: As an exchange we are willing to support with writing  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, providing Webspace, donate money - but there should be  
</I>&gt;<i> a sort of usable installation method for X2go?! Currently, no one in  
</I>&gt;<i> you team can imagine such a method. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, there has been quite some change in the team structure of  
</I>&gt;<i> the project that might have lead or lead the situation you have  
</I>&gt;<i> described in your mail (in German):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  (a) 4 computer scientists from University of Erlangen have joined the project
</I>&gt;<i>      team
</I>&gt;<i>  (b) I also have joined the project team and contributed new code (Python)
</I>&gt;<i>      that relates to X2go
</I>&gt;<i>  (c) development has moved (and is still moving) over to Git based development
</I>&gt;<i>  (d) code repository, package repository, wiki etc. have changed hosting and
</I>&gt;<i>      technology (esp. package building)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Technically, due to different contributions there also have been  
</I>&gt;<i> changes in concepts and code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (a) due to security issues the x2goserver code underwent a complete rewrite;
</I>&gt;<i>       for database setup - after taking a look at /etc/x2go - now use:
</I>&gt;<i>       x2godbadmin --createdb
</I>
OK! &#8730;

&gt;<i>   (b) x2goserver-one and x2goserver-home are obsolete, use x2goserver package
</I>&gt;<i>       instead.
</I>
OK! &#8730;

&gt;<i> The default installation will be an sqlite based x2goserver.
</I>&gt;<i>       For PostGres mode you have to configure the database part manually.
</I>&gt;<i>       This, unfortunately, still lacks documentation
</I>&gt;<i>   (c) x2goclient-gtk is deprecated. The development will focus on x2goclient
</I>&gt;<i>       (qt4)
</I>
OK! &#8730;

&gt;<i>   (d) the new X2go Thin Client Environment (for squeeze) is currently under
</I>&gt;<i>       heavy construction. I have a already 90% working setup under a  
</I>&gt;<i> Skolelinux
</I>&gt;<i>       test installation up and running. I currently also have a little project
</I>&gt;<i>       with another company running that have asked for an X2go TCE  
</I>&gt;<i> which I will
</I>&gt;<i>       provide them in a week or so...
</I>
Sounds interesting!

&gt;<i> We probably should take your criticism very seriously with respect to  
</I>&gt;<i> the mass of changes that have occurred recently and the lack of  
</I>&gt;<i> transparent documentation for these changes in our Wiki.
</I>
as I mentioned before: we are willing to help with documentation, webspace, maybe money ? ;-) as long this is a serious project. On the other hand; there are damn few alternatives to X2go ...

Not to forget: of course we can pay for regular X2go-Support and give the results and experiences back to the community. And we understand that X2go is a very ambitious project with little ressources ...


greetings from the other side of the Eems! ;-)
