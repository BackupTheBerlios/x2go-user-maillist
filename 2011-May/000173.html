<PRE>John

I've done this quite a bit and have not seen this problem

x2go client on ubuntu --(a)--- AWS EC2 Ubuntu desktop ---(b)--- AWS EC2
Windows 2003 serverl

   - link (a) is 15 Mbs cable connection
   - link (b) is 10Gbps ethernet

A few thoughts I'd have are:

   - is only RDP affected?
      - From x2go client can you log into the x2go server and do an extended
      PING (say 20 iterations or so) to the Windows Server to see if PING's
      response time is changing?
   - are you sure there are no network issues on the link btwn the x2go
   server to the windows server?  as it sounds like the VPN test went directly
   to the Windows server leaving out the link between the x2go server and
   Windows Server
   - Are you able to log directly into the x2go server ...not using x2go ...
   and run rdesktop directly to the window server just to see if RDP is having
   a problem over that link?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [X2go-user] Performance issues using RDP
</I>&gt;<i> Hello, all.  We were very eager to experiment with TSPlus
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.tsplus.net">http://www.tsplus.net</A>) as an alternative to Microsoft RDS.  We have
</I>&gt;<i> been assuming all along that performance of any RDP solution is better
</I>&gt;<i> in a low bandwidth WAN environment if we put X2Go in the middle of it
</I>&gt;<i> and run rdesktop from the X2Go Server to a local Windows server.  Our
</I>&gt;<i> results were very disappointing with both TSPlus and RDS and with both
</I>&gt;<i> rdesktop and xfreerdp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone else experienced the same poor performance or, more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, has anyone worked around it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We noticed that screens seemed to be painting line by line - not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> if it is the entire screen or just the active window.  It also made
</I>&gt;<i> mouse movements very erratic in TSPlus + rdesktop.  TSPlus + xfreerdp
</I>&gt;<i> seems better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To demonstrate this, I opened notepad in a large window in a full screen
</I>&gt;<i> session, typed an entire line, copied it to the clipboard and then held
</I>&gt;<i> down &lt;CTL&gt;V to paste it.  The first few lines flew but then it became
</I>&gt;<i> very slow and we could see the flicker of each line painting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also opened Internet Explorer and went to www.spiritualoutreach.org -
</I>&gt;<i> a very poorly designed site I put up years ago with long pages and far
</I>&gt;<i> too large graphics.  I sat and watched the screen paint a band at a
</I>&gt;<i> time.  I opened one of the large template documents and vertical
</I>&gt;<i> scrolling was nearly impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll paste in some of our internal notes below.  Thanks - John
</I>&gt;<i>
