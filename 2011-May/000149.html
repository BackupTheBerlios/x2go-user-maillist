<PRE>Hi Tim-Ole,

&gt;<i> thanx for your answer - and sorry, I actually forgot the reminder on  
</I>&gt;<i> the Mailman-website regarding the language ... by the way: a bit  
</I>&gt;<i> strange since X2go is as well a german-based project (as far as I  
</I>&gt;<i> can see) as the main part of information on the web is in german,  
</I>&gt;<i> too ... ;-) but there may not be enough interest for a standalone  
</I>&gt;<i> german-list.
</I>
There are quite a lot people from non-German speaking countries. And  
it is a double-effort having to cross-check localized lists...

&gt;<i> - we are working on a (professional) project with server-based  
</I>&gt;<i> computing. The main interest is to supersede Microsofts RDP and  
</I>&gt;<i> Nomachines NX.
</I>
Great!

&gt;<i> - we tried X2Go with the Installation-documents from www.x2go.org on  
</I>&gt;<i> different virtual machines (Debian Lenny, Squeeze, Ubuntu) - the  
</I>&gt;<i> installation is more or less straightforward, but the documentation  
</I>&gt;<i> is unfortunately full of errors. But it *is* possible to get X2go to  
</I>&gt;<i> work on the serverside - and the LDAP-scripts are very good (so far  
</I>&gt;<i> as we can see)!
</I>
What we actually need is someone who documents how LDAP/X2go actually  
works so that people can use this information to integrate X2go into  
their own LDAP trees. That would be of great value...

&gt;<i> - but none of the clients we tried worked :-( We tried those for  
</I>&gt;<i> MacOS on an 10.5.6-Intel-System, for Windows on a XP-System, and  
</I>&gt;<i> finally two clients for Ubuntu (x2goclient and x2goclient-gtk). It  
</I>&gt;<i> all results in more or less meaningful errormessages, crashes of the  
</I>&gt;<i> appliance and tine-outs on the client :-(
</I>
I can't say anything about the Mac client as I have never used it, so far.

With the others I do not have these basic problems at all.  
x2goclient-gtk is deprecated, so let's ignore that one.

x2goclient on Windows has undergone several changes lately. Mainly  
because of great problems with the shipped Xming XServer. We have  
internally moved to VcXsrv but there is not yet an x2goclient (Win32)  
release in close sight that ships with VcXsrv.

The x2goclient (Qt) for Linux works fine for me, but I do not use LDAP  
at all. The encountered problems might be to x2goserver setup  
misconfigurations?...

If you are interested in all these details around X2go development,  
please subscribe to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-user">x2go-dev at lists.berlios.de</A>

&gt;<i> We have *not* yet tested the Webclient and the Netboot-Environment.
</I>
Webclient is basically an X2goclient embedded in a qtbrowser plugin.  
The TCE env is under heavy development (for squeeze).

&gt;&gt;<i> Mike: I personally use X2go productively as a system administrator. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all networks I administrate there is one desktop workstation that runs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> x2goserver. I use GNOME or LXDE to access the network components from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this X2go server. I install x2goserver from the new squeeze repos and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything works out of the box (sqlite). As clients I use x2gocleint
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good! As we are documenting all the steps we execute in  
</I>&gt;<i> test-environments - do you have a (working! ;-))  
</I>&gt;<i> step-by-step-documentation for, lets say, Squeeze?
</I>
On the server (Debian):

   apt-get install x2goserver (from packages.x2go.org)

On the client (Debian):

   apt-get install x2goclient (from packages.x2go.org)

or:

   apt-get install pyhoca-gui (from packages.x2go.org)

Then configure a session profile for your x2goserver, ... DONE.

You may take a look at /etc/x2go for further options. It also might  
need some more effort to get printing, audio, file sharing etc.  
working, but I currently do not have a recipe at hand (I normally just  
fix what is missing :-( ).

&gt;<i> Oh, of course: I could send you our three documentations (Debian  
</I>&gt;<i> Squeeze / Debian Lenny / Ubuntu) where we have written down all the  
</I>&gt;<i> errors and broken links and strange behaviours we have experienced  
</I>&gt;<i> with x2go.
</I>
Do so and I will take a look.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also work for a company in the Netherlands that uses X2go for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full-featured SaaS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there may be hope ... ;-)
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> We probably should take your criticism very seriously with respect to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mass of changes that have occurred recently and the lack of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transparent documentation for these changes in our Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> as I mentioned before: we are willing to help with documentation,  
</I>&gt;<i> webspace, maybe money ? ;-) as long this is a serious project. On  
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand; there are damn few alternatives to X2go ...
</I>
It is a very serious project! Otherwise I would not give time and  
effort to it. Contributors to documentation is very welcome. If you  
can partially finance projects that would be really great. I,  
personally, prefer contracting for defined project parts. Definitely  
the defined task will decide about who has actually to work on it (we  
all have our special topcis within the project).

Greets,
Mike
