&gt;<i> I would say: Close the session before you close X2goclient. Don't

</I>
I may not have been clear in my previous message. Let me define some
terms so that we can be sure we understand each other:

x2go-client (X2C): this is the program and window that first gives you
a choice of starting an x2go session, and once a session is started,
it gives the options of &quot;share folder...&quot;, &quot;suspend&quot;, or &quot;terminate&quot;.

x2go-session (X2S) window: this is the window that displays the remote
session running on the x2go server. The only options are the standard
window options, like &quot;X&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, and full-screen.

So, if I close the X2S window by clicking &quot;X&quot;, then the session gets
suspended. But the only way I see to then terminate the session is to
click &quot;cancel&quot; in the X2C window, and then click to start a new
session, and then X2C gives me a list of running and suspended
sessions, but it only tells me the display number, the status, and the
command of each session. That is even less information than when the
session is running! So I do not want to terminate it from that list,
since I may make a mistake!

&gt;<i> You can see the server and the username when there is a connection.
</I>&gt;<i> And a SessionID. And a CreationTime.
</I>
Yes, the X2C window displays Session ID, Server, Username, Display,
Creation Time, and Status.

But it does not display the session name! That is the name that you
create yourself. You type it in at the top when you create a session
profile. I think it is useful to have when keeping track of multiple
sessions, since I try to define several different session names to
help me keep track.

This is a habit I developed when using the NX client, since it does
display the session names in the list of suspended sessions. In fact,
with NX client if your server only has 1 suspended session with the
session name that you try to start from the client, then the client
will automatically resume that session on the server without the user
even having to choose from a list of suspended sessions. That is a
useful feature.

&gt;<i> X2go just closes the session.
</I>
There are two ways to close the session: suspending it, in which case
the session keeps running, but without displaying a window on the
client (and you can later resume it on any other client machine), or
terminating it, in which case the session is no longer running, and
cannot be resumed.

If you just click on &quot;X&quot; in the X2S window, then x2go suspends the
session. I determined that just by trying it to see. If you want to
terminate a session, you have to specifically click on the &quot;terminate&quot;
button in the X2C window.

&gt;<i> I also don't know a nice way to suspend a session other then using the
</I>&gt;<i> client-window. Normally I don't suspend sessions. Maybe somebody else
</I>&gt;<i> knows a way.
</I>
As I mentioned, suspending a session is easy -- just click on the &quot;X&quot;
on the X2S window. It is terminating a session that is more difficult.

I generally have a lot of sessions, both running and suspended, on the
server, so the kind of issues I am mentioning come up a lot for me.

&gt;<i> I am talking about the Linux client. No idea if there is much
</I>&gt;<i> difference, because I have never used the Windows client.
</I>
I guess there is not much difference, but I thought I would mention it
just in case.
