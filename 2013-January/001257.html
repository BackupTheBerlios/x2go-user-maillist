<PRE>Hi,

following up on the subject, I found out some more things:

quote:
I also noticed that it works for user Z, I can open a session. But
currently never for user Y.

It really does not work for this user and I don't understand why. I have
enough space on the filesystem, I erased the .x2go directories in user Ys
home folder. I can login over ssh with Y, so that is not a problem.
This problem by the way started happening after a I had a power failure on
my server, so I wonder if something got corrupted. I reinstalled (purged)
x2goserver, so the x2go install should be fine.

I now receive the xhost unable to open display on any system I try it with,
with different OSes.


When connecting from Windows 7 to user Z, I can establish a X2go session
and when I use the Client app via gui, it fails to connect to user Y, BUT
if I run it in the CLI, it works:

*<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-user">mm at myserver</A>:~$ x2goclient-cli --user Y --server localhost
Password:
xhost:  unable to open display &quot;&quot;
xhost:  unable to open display &quot;&quot;
ln: creating symbolic link `/tmp/.x2go-Y/session-C-Y-52-1358533596.log':
File exists
xhost:  unable to open display &quot;&quot;*


So these xhost error messages are coming from the x2goserver and only for
that one user (which is the strangest thing)

So far I have not been able to enable debugging logging in x2goserver,
editing the config file and restarting the server. The x2goserver does
totally minimal logging and does not show what is wrong and why I cannot
establish the connection.


I have had lots and lots of trouble with xhost errors in the past, on any
Linux box and the documentation that exists on it is totally shady and
unconclusive. X seems to have a very weird idea of what security means and
how it is instituted. (at where root is not allowed to access a users
desktop without prior having given permission to it)

There must be something special about user Y, something that x2go saved in
the home dir. What directories would I have to clean up to erase all cache
/ config files that x2go might store there when an external client connects
to it?

Any pointers would be welcome.

Thanks,

Markus
