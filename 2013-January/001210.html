I set aside the regular known_hosts and let it create another as I
sshed over in terminal.  Then I tried pyhoca again and it still does
it.

I do notice though, that its message says RSA key.  Well I don't have
any SSH RSA keys, only DSA and ECDSA.  Maybe that's a clue.

On the other system (which always connects fine) I set aside my
known_hosts so there is none, connect with pyhoca to that system, and
it never even asks me if it's OK.  It just goes ahead and connects,
which is bizarre.
