<PRE>Admittedly, I haven't tested it.  I have read that NoMachine and X2Go
are incompatible, but I haven't tested X2Go with the older FreeNX
implementation.  I'll test it next week and post my results here on the
list.  As we've already got a few Ubuntu and RHEL6 systems up and
running on X2Go, I'd prefer to run X2Go on RHEL5 as well, but getting
anything working on RHEL5 as FreeNX would be wonderful.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems...literally months of productivity and time would be saved.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have not attempted a build form source on any test systems, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenSUSE repo packages didn't work either on my test systems nor on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production compute systems (the latter being obviously far more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex).  This would also remove a mandatory dependency on SunRay, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we can start deploying IGEL thin client alternatives...so essentially,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this would have a major positive impact on our day to day operations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I wasn't planning on having.  If there's anything I can do to help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you out, please let me know!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't the older but still working freenx from EPEL and the free NX
</I>&gt;<i> client work on your RHEL systems?    Will there be any conflict
</I>&gt;<i> between freenx and x2go rpms, and can you run both servers on the same
