<PRE>Orion-
   Any and all X2Go support in the EPEL for RHEL 5 and 6 would be
greatly appreciated.  As I mentioned, we are planning on moving away
from RHEL, but we will be saddled with various RHEL systems for at least
the next 12 months.  Having the ability to run X2Go on those systems
straight out of EPEL would save me from rebuilding some 15
systems...literally months of productivity and time would be saved.  I
have not attempted a build form source on any test systems, but the
OpenSUSE repo packages didn't work either on my test systems nor on the
production compute systems (the latter being obviously far more
complex).  This would also remove a mandatory dependency on SunRay, and
we can start deploying IGEL thin client alternatives...so essentially,
this would have a major positive impact on our day to day operations
that I wasn't planning on having.  If there's anything I can do to help
you out, please let me know!
