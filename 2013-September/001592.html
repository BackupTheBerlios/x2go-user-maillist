<PRE>Hi Markus, hi Lucian, et al.

first.. @Markus: didn't you want to work on the wiki's &quot;Get started&quot;  
page? It is dangling there as an empty page now and waiting for you to  
write it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nxproxy is not yet there as far as I know.
</I>
Nope.

&gt;<i> Yes, it might be a lot of work, but a worthy one: lots and lots of devices
</I>&gt;<i> come with Android.
</I>
Once we have nxproxy working on Android, then the rest rather needs  
diligence than magic. If an X-Server and nxproxy is in place then the  
rest of the X2Go client app writing (from scratch I suggest) is easy.

&gt;<i> Isn't there a functionality that lets you run an quasi app on a webserver
</I>&gt;<i> that then allows you to use a browser to emulate an X2goclient?
</I>&gt;<i> I have heard that you did such functionality and that it is finished. That
</I>&gt;<i> would be the solution: just run a apache webserver and then on Android
</I>&gt;<i> connect to the webserver with a browser and use X2goclient like this.
</I>
The x2goplugin you are referring to. It needs nxproxy (shipped with  
the plugin) and a local X-Server (on Windows: also shipped with the  
plugin's XPI). Before anyone asks: there is no recent x2goplugin  
version for Windows at the moment.

&gt;&gt;<i> you would run into problems there already. Next up would be code to control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when to show an on-screen keyboard, and translating touches on the screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A hardware keyboard would be a must (bluetooth), as otherwise you will lose
</I>&gt;<i> all screen real estate to the keyboard. But talking about Android also
</I>&gt;<i> means Tablets and on a 10 inch Tablet, X2go would be a totally wonderful
</I>&gt;<i> thing to use.
</I>
A further option is: use a tablet ready desktop shell in the X2Go  
session (like plasma active). They normally come with a screen  
keyboard. So, you just have to make sure that the Android screen  
keyboard does not interfere with whatever software keyboard you use in  
the X2Go Session.

&gt;<i> Considering how many devices exist that run Android, the &quot;market&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> huge. You may even be able to charge for the app (like 1 or 2 dollars) as
</I>&gt;<i> the X2goserver is already free and totally amazing to use. Often, Android
</I>&gt;<i> users are convenience users, lazier than PC or Laptop users and will
</I>&gt;<i> preferably shell out some cash before looking around for a free alternative
</I>&gt;<i> that needs more work.
</I>&gt;<i> And I would definitely buy it for 1 or 2 dollars, it would be well worth it.
</I>
Charging is fine, a non-free license will not be supported by me  
(personal statement). I vote give my time to that project if the  
license is other than GPL or AGPL.

&gt;<i> (providing a free trial version that is limited to 5 minutes for a session
</I>&gt;<i> so people can try it out would work great)
</I>
urgghhh... nononono...

&gt;&gt;<i> to mouse input. To sum it up, I think it would require a lot of work to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> x2go to an even remotely usable state on Android.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can also connect a mouse to an Android tablet/smartphone by the way. My
</I>&gt;<i> Gingerbread (2.3) Ice cream Sandwich (4.0) and Jelly Bean (4.2) Android all
</I>&gt;<i> supported plugging in a mouse and keyboard via USB connector, it just
</I>&gt;<i> treats it as HID, and simulates it, so you can use the cursor keys to more
</I>&gt;<i> from app icon to app icon or ESC to go back, as well as getting a mouse
</I>&gt;<i> pointer to click on stuff. I was amazed how dynamic this works.
</I>
Yeah.

&gt;<i> Anyway, for the short term, the webserver solution should work easier.
</I>
This does not exist for Android!!! It only works (in theory) for those  
platforms that X2Go Client is available for.
