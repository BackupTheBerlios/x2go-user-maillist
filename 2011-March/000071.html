<PRE>I downloaded a copy of the source by using this command: git clone <A HREF="git://">git://</A>
code.x2go.org/x2goserver.git

I want to try to make a module on NodeJS, and I had assumed that I would get
a bunch of source files written in C or C++, but what I got was a bunch of
Perl scripts.

Is that all the server is?  Am I missing something?  My goal is to make an
NX server that can run over a simple TCP or HTTP server and I was going to
write a client for display in the browser.  From my research, X2Go is
supposed to be the most fully featured, open source NX implementation out
there.  I downloaded the source from NoMachine.com for part of their server
and it was as I expected, a bunch of C and C++ sources.

With NodeJS, I have a couple of options:

   - Include a C++ module by exporting certain functions
   - Write the source in server-side JavaScript
   - Use the exec command to execute scripts on the command-line


If the server really is that simple, then my project will be a lot less
painful and will take me a lot less time than expected to make work with
NodeJS.  If the server really is this simple, how does it compare
performance-wise with the open source version from NoMachine?  I want to
possibly have several NX servers piped through a single webserver where each
NX server is running in it's own VM, so efficiency is what I'm after.  I am
primarily looking at just running this on Ubuntu, so this package looked
like it was the right one (debian).

Any help that any of you could offer would be much appreciated.  I'm excited
to start playing with this software!!  Don't worry, anything I produce will
be Open Source, regardless of whether I do a complete rewrite.
