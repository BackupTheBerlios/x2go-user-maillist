Welcome, Tyler.  I'll take a stab at explaining this in case the devs
don't have a chance to respond.  Of course, take anything they say as
more authoritative than anything I say!

There is a difference between X2Go and NX.  X2Go strives to be much more
than just remote screens and keystrokes.  By leveraging many open source
projects (e.g., sshfs, fuse, pulseaudio, libssh, vcxsrv, nx) it strives
to create a complete desktop experience including printing, sound, local
file shares.  Note that I mentioned it leverages the NX code which is
why you will not find the actual NX source inside X2Go.

The server side is largely a collection of scripts.  In fact, starting
the x2goserver process really does not start the server.  It starts a
cleanup script to handle maintenance of stopped/suspended sessions.  The
client actually invokes the various scripts via ssh.  If you download
the client, you will find a bunch of Qt/C++ code and it is this code
which calls the various x2goserver scripts to do things like set up file
shares, audio, and invoke NX with the proper arguments.  Hope that helps
- John
