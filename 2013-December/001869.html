<PRE>We are using gnome-session-fallback as a desktop environment. Unity also has issues. We have tried the following settings with Gnome,

&#160;
Adjustment - Bottom panel fails yes/no

adjust screensize: yes

mark xinerama: yes

set fullscreen: yes

set customdesktop: yes

use wholedisplay: yes

&#160;
Unfortunately using xfce is not an option because the employees are already working on Gnome for a few years now. And it would be to much of a change for now.
&#160;

We also run Ubuntu 12.04 on the server, with XFCE 4.10 as the desktop environment. I have heard that Unity can be problematic when paired with x2go. Not sure if this is still an issue.
I run Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity on my main desktop, and regularly log on to our terminal servers with x2goclient, and don't have the mentioned problem. I would guess that the real problem is that the resolution chosen by x2goclient (by however much space is occupied on your Mac screen), isn't being picked up by Unity. I think that was the problem with Unity before. I think Gnome had the same problems. That is one of the reasons we chose XFCE instead. That and not wanting fancy 3D compositing to happen on a remote desktop :)

Hi Anders,

&#160;
Thank you for the quick reply! Good to read that you are not experiencing the same issue. This indeed concerns the bottom-panel of the remote desktop session, not on the Mac itself. We are running a Ubuntu 12.04 desktop. So most likely this is setting on the clientside then?
 At first the same thing happened when connecting from Ubuntu 13.04 to the Ubuntu desktop, but after enabling Xinerama extension the bottom-panel reappeared. I've tried the same thing on the Mac's without success.

 

&#160;
Kind regards,

&#160;
Mervin

Hi Mervin,
&#160;I run x2goclient on a bunch of Macs (started around Snow Leopard and have gradually upgraded to now run on Mavericks) and I don't have any problems with the bottom-panel not showing. I am guessing you are talking about the bottom-panel of the remote desktop, and not anything on your Mac desktop. Which desktop environment are you running on the Linux-side?

Hello,

&#160;
I'm currently implementing a X2GO environment to accommodate Mac Lion OSX users.

The client seems to have some issues however, when I start-up a session the bottom-panel is not visible.

 

I've experienced this on two laptops now. Is this really a bug or is it just a setting on the clientside?

 

&#160;
Thank you in advance!

&#160;
Kind regards,

&#160;
Mervin
