<PRE>Hi Mike,

Thanks for trying to reproduce. The suggestions you made put me on a debug path that uncovered a possibly working solution and some interesting information.

For reference, our configuration that duplicates this is:
RHEL 6.4
XEmacs 21.4.22
X2Go Server 4.0.1.6
X2Go Client 4.0.1.1 or 4.0.1.2pre02
Windows 7 64-bit

Based on your suggestion I recompiled XEmacs without motif and the problem was not resolved, so it does not appear to be motif related. I noted however that you are running XEmacs from the 21.5 beta branch, so I compiled the latest 21.5.34 version from that branch. The problem went away.

XEmacs 21.4.22 is the last stable release and is what we have been using. Since 21.5.34 beta does not have the select/paste issue with X2Go, we are going to have some users try this release to see if it is stable enough for use.

If you would still like to duplicate the issue for debugging purposes, I think if you compiled XEmacs 21.4.22 you would have a good shot at seeing it.

Thanks,
Nick

Hi Nick,

(Sorry about this duplicate email. I forgot to CC the list on the last one.)

I was unable to reproduce your bug on this setup:
- Fedora 19 64-bit with XEmacs 21.5.34, x2goserver 4.0.1.6 &amp; nx-libs 3.5.0.21
- Windows 8.1 64-bit with x2goclient 4.0.1.2pre02 (see the X2go-Dev
email discussion on 4.0.1.2pre01 for more info on this build)

Can you please tell us what Linux distro
 you are running XEmacs (and
the x2go server) on? See my reasoning below.

However, I have this same problem with NEdit, which uses OpenMotif as
its graphical toolkit. And I just reproduced this issue with NEdit
from my windows client detailed above.&#160; I've observed it on x2goclient
4.0.0.3 on Windows 7 64-bit also. I've observed it on Fedora 19,
(details listed above) CentOS 6, RHEL 6 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
XEmacs appears to support multiple toolkits according to this link.
<A HREF="http://www.us.xemacs.org/Download/optLibs.html">http://www.us.xemacs.org/Download/optLibs.html</A>
Perhaps this bug only occurs when XEmacs is using OpenMotif? I need to
investigate this further, but I'm thinking that XEmacs uses OpenMotif
on your distro,
 but it uses another toolkit on Fedora 19.

-Mike
