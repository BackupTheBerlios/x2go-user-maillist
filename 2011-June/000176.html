<PRE>Hi

What I can contribute is that I have been using X2go for more than 6 months
now and very successfully. I run the server on Debian Squeeze (and Lenny
before) and connect to it from Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 and Debian Squeeze
(Laptops).
So far I have had some issues, but it is very stable. So stable in fact that
I am often working remotely on my server at home (connect over the internet
via SSH). Resuming works almost always and I have to say, I am surprised how
well it works. I would like to extend my congratulations and thanks for this
nice piece of software to you developers! I have used Nxserver and NXfree
(or freenx, I always confuse them) and that used to work much worse, with
suspending and resuming spotty at best.

(I have to admit that this does not comment the commercial version of
NXserver, which must be much better I am sure)

It is unfortunate that you have having so much trouble getting it to work, I
can relate to this, as your question indicates, like &quot;is this working
ANYWHERE?&quot; and yes it does, very well. So I am sure there must be some way
that you can get it to work.
But when it comes to open source, yes, the documentation can be lacking and
sometimes it takes a long time and strains the patience. What I can say is
that it is worth the work, since the software works very nice and I am glad
that finally I can use my server at home as the unlimited (no more 2 or 3
user limit) terminal server that I have always wanted. Even audio forwarding
works (on Windows, so I can hear the pulseaudio on my server session, EVEN
THOUGH I have Jackd audio deamon running on it. How this can work is beyond
me, a positive surprise to be sure. And filesharing works also.

I also understand and write German, but I understand that this mailing list
should be kept in English, so I hope you can understand me. I know that my
configuration is kinda simplified, as I am not using LDAP or any kind of
complex user authentication mechanism. It might be easier to get it working
simple, before trying to tacke these. The repository that I am using
currently are these, just in case this helps:

deb <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A> lenny main

(I actually went to my open terminal session window and copy pasted it (even
this works))

As you see, I am still using the lenny repository (in case there is a newer
one) and use the server

and here are the packages that I have currently installed:

pinentry-x2go                                   install
pinentry-x2go-gtk                               install
x2goagent                                       install
x2gocdmanager                                   install
x2goclient                                      install
x2goclient-cli                                  install
x2goclient-gtk                                  install
x2gokdebindings                                 install
x2goserver                                      install
x2goserver-home                                 install
x2goserver-one                                  install
x2gospyglass                                    install
x2gousbmount                                    install

Just in case this helps...

as you can see I am using the x2goserver-home or one version which is
simplified without all the bells of whistles of authentication, if I
understand it correctly.

I remember one issue that I had was about Xming not running in Windows
(which is the component that acts as Xserver). In my case it was not started
automatically.

Another thing is my /etc/sudoers   config


### X2GO section
%x2gousers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/x2gopgwrapper


#### X2GOPRINT section
x2goprint ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/x2goprint


And I remember having an issue with that.

These settings might be too insecure for your taste, but it is easiest to
first open things up and circle the problem wide, to see where it is located
at.

Hope this helps..

Markus
